Make sure to check the box during installation for \"Add Python to PATH\" if you want to be able to run Python scripts directly from any directory in your command prompt or terminal.\n\n2. **Create a new file**: Open your preferred text editor, such as Notepad (for Windows) or TextEdit (for Mac). We'll call this `hello_world.py`. You can name it anything you like but make sure to use the `.py` extension to indicate that it's a Python script.\n\n3. **Write the code**: Copy and paste the \"Hello, World!\" example provided above into your text editor and save the file as `hello_world.py`.\n\n4. **Navigate to the folder containing your Python file** using your command prompt (for Windows) or terminal (for Mac/Linux). You can do this by typing `cd path/to/your/file` in your terminal, replacing \"path/to/your/file\" with the actual path where you saved `hello_world.py`.\n\n5. **Run the Python script**: In your command prompt or terminal window (for Windows Command Prompt), type the following and hit Enter:\n\n   ```\n   python hello_world.py\n   ```\n\n   If everything is set up correctly, this should display the text \"Hello, World!\" in the console where you ran it from.\n\nIf you're using a Unix-like operating system (e.g., Mac or Linux), use `python3` instead of just `python`. For example:\n\n```bash\npython3 hello_world.py\n```\n\nThis will also print \"Hello, World!\" to your terminal.\n\nThat's it!
