For this example, let's use an online Python compiler like Repl.it.\n\n   - Go to https://repl.it/languages/python3\n\n2. **Write the Code**:\n   - In the editor, you'll see a text area where you can write your code.\n   - Copy and paste or type the following code:\n\n     ```python\n     print(\"Hello, World!\")\n     ```\n\n3. **Save Your File (Optional but Recommended)**: If you're using an online compiler like Repl.it, you don't need to save files locally. However, for local text editors, remember to save your file with a `.py` extension before running it.\n\n4. **Run the Code**:\n\n   - For Repl.it:\n     - Click on \"Run\" or press `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Enter` (Mac). The output will appear in the console at the bottom of the page, showing:\n       ```\n       Hello, World!\n       ```\n\n   - **For Local Python Installation**:\n     - Open your terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved your `.py` file using the `cd` command (e.g., `cd /path/to/your/file`).\n     - Run the script by typing `python filename.py` and press Enter. Replace `filename` with the name of your Python file. You should see the output in the terminal:\n       ```\n       Hello, World!\n       ```\n\n5. **Verify the Output**: Check if you've seen the printed message \"Hello, World!\" on your screen or console.
