The string `\"Hello, World!\"` is passed as an argument to this function. When executed, it will print \"Hello, World!\" to the console.\n\n**Running the Hello World Example:**\n\nTo run this Python code, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, download and install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to select the option that includes the Python interpreter during installation.\n\n2. **Create a new file**: Open your preferred text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or even Notepad on Windows. Create a new file and save it with a `.py` extension, for example, `hello_world.py`.\n\n3. **Write the code**: Copy and paste the \"Hello, World!\" Python code into this newly created file.\n\n4. **Open a terminal/command prompt**: On Windows, press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, then press Enter to open Command Prompt. On macOS or Linux, use `Terminal`.\n\n5. **Navigate to your project directory**: In the command line, navigate to the folder where you saved `hello_world.py` using the `cd` (change directory) command. For example:\n\n   ```\n   cd path/to/your/project\n   ```\n\n6. **Run the Python script**: Type `python hello_world.py` and press Enter. If everything is set up correctly, you should see \"Hello, World!\" printed in your terminal or command prompt.\n\nIf you encounter any issues, ensure that:\n- You've installed Python properly.\n- The file extension is `.py`.\n- Your working directory (the folder where `hello_world.py` resides) is correct and accessible from the command line.\n\nFor a more interactive environment without needing to open a terminal/command prompt, you can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Popular Python IDEs include:\n\n- **Visual Studio Code**: Install the Python extension by Microsoft. You can then run your Python scripts directly within the editor using the built-in debugger and console.\n- **PyCharm**: A full-featured IDE from JetBrains, which supports Python development out of the box with features like code completion, debugging, and testing.\n- **Jupyter Notebook**: If you're interested in data science or scientific computing, Jupyter Notebooks provide an interactive environment where you can write and run Python code alongside text, images, and visualizations.\n\nTo run your \"Hello, World!\" script using these IDEs:\n1. Open the file `hello_world.py`.\n2. Click on a button (like Run or Debug) in the toolbar or use a keyboard shortcut to execute the Python code within the editor's environment.\n3.
