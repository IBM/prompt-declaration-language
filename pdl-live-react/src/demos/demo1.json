Save the text above in a file with a `.py` extension, for example, `hello_world.py`.\n2. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n3. Navigate to the directory where you saved `hello_world.py` using the `cd` command (e.g., `cd /path/to/your/directory`).\n4. Run the Python script by typing `python hello_world.py` and pressing Enter.
