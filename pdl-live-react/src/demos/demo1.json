Here's a simple \"Hello, World!\" program in Python, which is one of the most popular programming languages:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\nThis single line of code will output the text \"Hello, World!\" when run.\n\nTo run this Python script, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already installed Python on your computer, download and install it from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to select the option that includes the Python interpreter during installation.\n\n2. **Create a new file**: Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or even Notepad on Windows. Create a new file and save it with a `.py` extension, for example, `hello_world.py`.\n\n3. **Copy the Python code**: Copy the \"Hello, World!\" script provided above into your newly created text file.\n\n4. **Open a terminal/command prompt**: On Windows, press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit Enter to open Command Prompt. On macOS or Linux, use `Terminal`.\n\n5. **Navigate to the directory containing your Python file**: Use the `cd` command (for Unix-based systems) or `cd` followed by the path (for Windows) to change into the folder where you saved `hello_world.py`. For example:\n\n   - On Unix/Linux:\n     ```\n     cd /path/to/your/directory\n     ```\n   - On macOS:\n     ```\n     cd ~/Desktop\n     ```\n\n6. **Run the Python script**: Type `python hello_world.py` and press Enter. If everything is set up correctly, you should see \"Hello, World!\" printed in your terminal or command prompt.\n\nHere's what happens under the hood:\n\n- When you run a `.py` file, the Python interpreter reads it line by line.\n- The first line of code (`print(\"Hello, World!\")`) tells the interpreter to display the text \"Hello, World!\" on the screen.\n- The `print()` function is a built-in Python function that outputs the specified string (enclosed in quotes) to the console or terminal.\n- After executing this line, the program ends, and control returns to the command prompt or terminal.\n\nThat's it!
