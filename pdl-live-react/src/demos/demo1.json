Save the above line as a `.py` file, for instance, `hello_world.py`.\n2. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n3. Navigate to the directory where you saved `hello_world.py`.\n4. Run the following command (replace 'hello_world' with the actual name of your Python file if it's different):\n   ```\n   python hello_world.py\n   ```\n5.
