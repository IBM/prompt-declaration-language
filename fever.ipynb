The series stars James Roday as Shawn Spencer, a young crime consultant for the Santa Barbara Police Department whose \"heightened observational skills\" and impressive eidetic memory allow him to convince people that he solves cases with psychic abilities. The program also stars Dulé Hill as Shawn\\'s intelligent best friend and reluctant partner Burton \"Gus\" Guster, as well as Corbin Bernsen as Shawn\\'s father Henry, a former detective with the Santa Barbara Police Department.\\nPsych premiered on July 7, 2006, following the fifth-season premiere of Monk, and continued to be paired with the series until Monk\\'s conclusion on December 4, 2009. During the second season, an animated segment titled \"The Big Adventures of Little Shawn and Gus\" was added to the series. Psych was the highest-rated US basic cable television premiere of 2006. USA Network renewed the series for an eighth season on December 19, 2012, to include eight episodes, and ordered two more episodes on June 25, 2013, bringing the episode order to ten. On February 5, 2014, USA Network confirmed that the eighth season of Psych would be its last, with the series finale airing on March 26, 2014.\\nPsych: The Movie, a two-hour television film, aired on USA Network on December 7, 2017, launching the Psych film series, with Franks\\' hope being to make five more Psych movies following Psych: The Movie. On February 14, 2019, it was announced Psych: The Movie 2 was greenlit and set to premiere in late 2019, for which the main cast would return, but the premiere thereof was subsequently delayed to 2020, with the film renamed Psych 2: Lassie Come Home, and released on NBCUniversal\\'s streaming service, Peacock, July 15, 2020, the day the service officially launched.

      "Underdog (film) Underdog is a 2007 American superhero comedy film based on W. Watts Biggers, Chet Stover, and Joe Harris‘ 1960s animated television series Underdog, which in turn is a spoof on the DC Comics character Superman, created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. Directed by Frederik Du Chau and written by Joe Piscatella, Adam Rifkin, and Craig A. Williams, the film stars Jim Belushi, Peter Dinklage, John Slattery, and Patrick Warburton with the voice talents of Jason Lee, Amy Adams, and Brad Garrett. Unlike the TV series, the Underdog character is portrayed as a regular dog rather than an anthropomorphic one. Underdog/Shoeshine, voiced by Jason Lee, was played by a lemon beagle named Leo sporting a red sweater and a blue cape. The film grossed $65.3 million worldwide and received generally negative reviews from critics.\n",
      "James Jones (basketball player) James Andrew Jones (born October 4, 1980) is an American professional basketball executive and former player. He is both the president of basketball operations and general manager for the Phoenix Suns. He played 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n",
      "Jones was a four-year letterman at American High School in Hialeah, Florida. He averaged 25 points per game as a senior, earning Class 6A Player of the Year and First-team All-State honors. Jones played college basketball for the Miami Hurricanes of the University of Miami, where he was a three-year starter and finished his career averaging 11 points per game. He was named Third-team All-Big East his junior year and Second-team Verizon Academic All-American his senior year. He was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame in 2014.\n",
      "Jones was drafted by the Indiana Pacers in the second round of the 2003 NBA draft. He went on to play for the Pacers, Phoenix Suns, Portland Trail Blazers, Miami Heat and Cleveland Cavaliers. He won three NBA championships, two with the Heat and one with the Cavaliers. Jones was never on an NBA team with a losing record and only missed the playoffs once—with the Trail Blazers in 2007–08. He finished third in the NBA in three-point percentage during the 2007–08 season and won the Three-Point Contest in 2011. His nickname is \"Champ\".\n"

Being moved by the lack of support for returning veterans through his life Tarquin decided to compose a heavy instrumental rock album as a way to show his appreciation to all veterans. So once again he enlisted top notch players to guest with him on the album, Billy Sheehan on Black Hawk, Ron \\\"Bumblefoot\\\" Thal and Reb Beach on Taliban Terror, Steve Morse on Freedom, Chris Poland on Charlie Surfs and Hunting, Chuck Loeb on Escape Kabul, Hal Lindes on Sand & Blood, Gary Hoey on 5 Klicks To Hell and Baghdad, Alex De Rosso Dokken on Broken Arrow, and The Flyin' Ryan Brothers on Surgical Strike.

He led the Pacers to a 19-game improvement over the previous season, finishing 58\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009324 \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 at the time, the most the franchise had ever won as an NBA team, and tying the 1970\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009371 ABA Pacers for the franchise record. Chris Mullin joined the team in the off-season and immediately became a valuable part of the Pacers lineup\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094and starting small forward.

Milhouse has a crush on Bart\\'s sister, Lisa, a common plot element.\\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was designed by Matt Groening for a planned series on NBC, which was abandoned.[4] The design was then used for a Butterfinger commercial, and it was decided to use the character in the series.[5][6] Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. The name was the most \"unfortunate name Matt Groening could think of for a kid\".[1] Years earlier, in a 1986 Life in Hell comic entitled \"What to Name the Baby\", Groening listed Milhouse as a name \"no longer recommended\".[7] Milhouse is a favorite among the staff as Al Jean noted \"most of the writers are more like Milhouse than Bart\".[1] His last name was given to him by Howard Gewirtz, a freelance writer who wrote the episode \"Homer Defined\". Gewirtz got the name from one of his wife\\'s friends.[8] According to Arden Myrin and Dana Gould (former writer and co-executive producer of The Simpsons), Rob Cohen (Simpsons writer) inspired Milhouse\\'s look.[2]\\nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\\nQuestion: Guitars for Wounded Warriors is an album that was recorded in the village in which New York county?\\nThought 1: I need to search Guitars for Wounded Warriors, then find in which New York county it was recorded.\\nAction 1: Search[Guitars for Wounded Warriors]\\nObservation 1: Guitars for Wounded Warriors is the sixth solo studio album by guitarist Brian Tarquin, released in August 2014 by Cleopatra Records.

Chris Mullin joined the team in the off-season and immediately became a valuable part of the Pacers lineupâ\\x80\\x94and starting small forward. Assistant coaches Rick Carlisle, in charge of the offense, and Dick Harter, who coached the defense, were key in getting the most out of the Pacers\\' role players such as Dale Davis, Derrick McKey and a young Antonio Davis. Miller and Rik Smits both made the All-Star team that year, and in the playoffs, the Pacers breezed past the Cleveland Cavaliers and New York Knicks before falling to the Chicago Bulls in a seven-game Eastern Conference Finals.\\nThought 4: In the 1997-98 season, former Boston Celtics great Larry Bird was hired as head coach.
