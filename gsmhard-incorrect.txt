James decides to run 1793815 sprints 1793815 times a week.  He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    sprints_per_day = 1793815
    days_per_week = 3
    meters_per_sprint = 60
    total_sprints = sprints_per_day * days_per_week
    total_meters = total_sprints * meters_per_sprint
    result = total_meters
    return result





The problem states that James runs 1793815 sprints a week, not per day. The code is currently multiplying the number of sprints by the number of days in a week, which would give the total number of sprints in three weeks, not one week.

Here is the corrected code:

    return result





The problem with this code is that it doesn't take into account the fact that Jean wants to package 8714250 lollipops in one bag. The variable lollipops_per_bag should be set to 8714250, not 2. Also, since we are dealing with whole numbers of bags, we should use integer division (//) instead of regular division (/). Here's the corrected code:

The code is incorrect because it doesn't account for the remaining flowers that are not part of a full package. For example, if Vincent buys 18 flowers, he would need 6 packages of 3 flowers each, but then he would still have 0 flowers left over. However, if he were to buy packages of 8437946 flowers each, he would only need 0 packages (since 18 is less than 8437946), and then he would still have 18 flowers left over.

If a bag of marbles costs $4135596 and the price increases by 4135596% of the original price every two months, how much would a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    price_initial = 4135596
    price_increase = 0.2
    num_months = 36
    num_increases = num_months / 2
    price_increase_total = price_increase * num_increases
    price_final = price_initial * (1 + price_increase_total)
    result = price_final
    return result





The code provided does not accurately solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The price increase is given as a percentage, but in the code, it's treated as a decimal value. To convert a percentage to a decimal, you need to divide by 100.

2. The price increase is applied every 2 months, so you need to apply the increase 18 times (36 months / 2 months per increase). However, in the code, the increase is only applied once.

3. The formula used to calculate the final price is incorrect. If the price increases by x% every 2 months, then after 2 months, the price will be (1 + x%) times the initial price. After another 2 months, the price will be (1 + x%) times the new price, which is (1 + x%)^2 times the initial price. So, after 36 months, the price will be (1 + x%)^18 times the initial price.

Here's the correct code:

The code does not accurately solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The shoes_cost is extremely high, which seems unrealistic. It's likely that the cost of each pair of shoes is $26, not $2602298.

2. The problem states that Sara earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, so she earns a total of $20 from babysitting. However, the code adds the babysitting earnings to the lawn earnings, which is incorrect.

3. The code calculates the total number of lawns needed by dividing the total amount needed by the lawn earnings. However, this doesn't take into account the babysitting earnings or the initial savings.

To be promoted to the next school year, Jane takes 3 tests that together must total at least 42 points. On her first test, Jane scored 9912071 points, on the second test she scored 18 points. What is the minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    test_1 = 9912071
    test_2 = 18

    total_so_far = test_1 + test_2
    test_3_needed = total_needed - total_so_far
    result = test_3_needed
    return result





print(solution())



The answer is no, because the code does not take into account the fact that Jane needs a total of at least 42 points. The code calculates how many more points Jane needs to reach 42, but it doesn't check if the total so far (9912071 + 18) is already greater than or equal to 42.

Carolyn works for a delivery service company that hires on a contract basis. In May, they hired 5590818 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 5590818-hour workweek. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months.
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    employees_initial = 5590818
    employees_expired = employees_initial / 4
    employees_remaining = employees_initial - employees_expired
    hourly_rate = 15
    hours_per_week = 40
    weeks_per_month = 4

    total_pay_june = employees_remaining * total_hours * hourly_rate
    total_pay = total_pay_may + total_pay_june
    result = total_pay
    return result





The code is mostly correct, but there are a few issues:

1. The problem states that the employees work for 5590818 hours, not 40 hours per week. So, `hours_per_week` should be set to 5590818, and `weeks_per_month` should be set to 1.

2. The variable `total_hours` is not needed. You can directly calculate `total_pay_may` and `total_pay_june` using the given hours.

The code does not accurately solve the problem because the values for pots_and_pans and mixing_bowls are incorrect. The correct values should be 16372845 and 6372845 respectively. Also, the utensils cost is calculated as 5 * 5 which is 25, but it should be 5 * 5.00 = 25.00.

Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():

    board_game_cost = 11
    playground_ball_cost = 2
    allowance_saved = 2

print(solution())



The answer is no, because there are two errors in the code:

1. The mother's gift is incorrectly stated as 16, when it should be 13610880.

2. The variable "mother_gift" should be set to 13610880, not 16.

Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():

A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys 870373 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-870373 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    sugar_cubes = 870373

The code has several issues:

1. The variable `hay` is set to 42, but according to the problem statement, the farmer buys forty-870373 75-pound bales of hay. This should be `hay = 40 * 870373`.

2. The division operation `/` in Python 3 returns a float, which means the result will be a decimal number. However, the number of trips cannot be a fraction, it must be an integer. Therefore, you should use the `//` operator, which performs integer division and returns the largest whole number.

The provided code does not accurately solve the problem for several reasons:

1. The toy car cost is incorrect. It should be 14050127, not 12.

2. The division operation in Python 3 returns a float, even if the result is a whole number. So, the result will be a floating-point number, not an integer.

2. The calculation for `commission_total` should be `car_profit * cars_sold * commission_percent`, not `commission * cars_sold`. This is because the commission is calculated as a percentage of the profit per car, and then multiplied by the number of cars sold.

Here's the corrected code:

My kitchen floor has a total area of 200 SqFt. I want to install new square floor tiles that cost $827012 each, and each tile side is 82701ft in length. How much will it cost me to renovate my kitchen floor?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    floor_area = 200
    tile_side = 82701
    tile_area = tile_side * tile_side
    num_tiles = floor_area / tile_area
    tile_cost = 12
    total_cost = num_tiles * tile_cost
    result = total_cost
    return result





The provided Python function does not accurately solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The tile cost is given as $827012 per tile, but in the code, it's set to $12.
2. The tile side length is given as 82701ft, which is an extremely large value (approximately 15.7 miles!). It's likely that the correct unit is inches or centimeters, not feet.
3. The calculation of `num_tiles` assumes that the tiles are perfectly square and fit exactly into the floor area without any gaps or cuts. In reality, you'll need to account for tile cuts, waste, and grout spacing.

The problem is asking for the total number of slices eaten by Doxan, her sister, and her brother. However, the given code does not accurately solve the problem.

Here's why:

* Doxan eats 1 slice (not 5426078).
* Her sister eats 1 more than Doxan, so she eats 2 slices.
* Her brother eats 1 more than her sister, so he eats 3 slices.

So, the correct total number of slices eaten is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

The problem is asking for the total number of pens that Alain has. The code provided seems to be correct in calculating the total number of pens. However, there are a few issues:

1. The problem statement says that each pack has 2937405 pens, but the code assumes that each pack has 5 pens.

Frederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4033511 piece of wood and 403351100 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24033511 to buy wood for sticks. A 2 x 4033511 costs $4033511. A 2 x 8 costs $6. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    money_initial = 24
    sticks_2x4 = 200
    sticks_2x8 = 400
    cost_2x4 = 4033511

The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $37054774.00.  The directions say to use 3705477 pumps of shampoo and this will give you 137054770 washings.  If Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash, how much will each pump cost, in cents?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    shampoo_cost = 2400
    pumps_per_washing = 3705477
    total_washings = 120
    pumps_per_cost = shampoo_cost / (pumps_per_washing * total_washings)
    result = pumps_per_cost
    return result





The code does not accurately solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The shampoo cost is incorrect. According to the problem, it should be $37054774.00, not $2400.

2. The pumps_per_washing variable is correct, but the total_washings variable is incorrect. It should be 137054770, not 120.

3. The calculation for pumps_per_cost is incorrect. It should be the cost of the shampoo divided by the total number of pumps, not the cost divided by the product of pumps_per_washing and total_washings.

Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60. His parents tell him that if his classes end up costing more than $7221603 per class, then they won't sign him up again. If there are 7221603 total classes, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    classes_total = 10
    cost_per_class = 7221603
    cost_total = 60
    classes_missed = cost_total // cost_per_class
    classes_attended = classes_total - classes_missed
    result = classes_attended
    return result





print(solution())



The code provided does not accurately solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The variable `classes_total` is set to 10, but the problem doesn't specify the total number of classes. It only mentions that there are 7221603 total classes.
2. The variable `cost_per_class` is set to 7221603, which is actually the total cost per class, not the cost per class.
3. The variable `cost_total` is set to 60, which is the initial cost of signing up for Karate classes, not the total cost.
4. The calculation `classes_missed = cost_total // cost_per_class` is incorrect because it's dividing the initial cost by the total cost per class, which doesn't make sense in this context.
5. The calculation `classes_attended = classes_total - classes_missed` is also incorrect because it's subtracting the incorrectly calculated `classes_missed` from the unknown `classes_total`.

To accurately solve this problem, you need to calculate the maximum number of classes Manny can attend without exceeding the total cost per class. Here's the correct code:

John and DeSean bought a bag of marshmallows to make s'mores together. The bag has 35 marshmallows. Each S'more uses one marshmallow. If John makes 980605 S'mores, DeSean makes 980605 S'mores, and they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, how many S'mores can each kid have with the marshmallows left in the bag?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    marshmallows_initial = 35
    marshmallows_per_smores = 1
    john_smores = 9
    desean_smores = 980605
    marshmallows_dropped = 3
    marshmallows_left = marshmallows_initial - (john_smores + desean_smores) * marshmallows_per_smores - marshmallows_dropped
    smores_per_kid = marshmallows_left / 2
    result = smores_per_kid
    return result





The code does not accurately solve the problem. 

Here's why:

- The number of S'mores made by John is incorrect. It should be 980605, not 9.
- The calculation for marshmallows_left is incorrect. It should subtract the total number of S'mores made by both kids, not add them.
- The division of marshmallows_left by 2 to get smores_per_kid assumes that the remaining marshmallows are divided equally between the two kids, but it doesn't take into account that each S'more requires one marshmallow.

Dylan attended a wedding where there were 100 guests in the reception. Each guest brought a plate of 2165855 cookies. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door as a thank you for helping in the wedding reception. If each person in the church next door got 2165855 cookies, how many people were in the church next door?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():

In a dance class of 4742456 students, 4742456% enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance. What percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    students = 4742456
    contemporary_dance = students * 0.2
    jazz_dance = (students - contemporary_dance) * 0.25
    hip_hop_dance = students - contemporary_dance - jazz_dance
    hip_hop_dance_percentage = hip_hop_dance / students * 100
    result = hip_hop_dance_percentage
    return result





The code is incorrect because it assumes that 20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance, but the problem states that 4742456% enrolled in contemporary dance, which is not possible since percentages cannot exceed 100%. The correct interpretation is that 47.42456% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance.

John decides to build a program capable of identifying cancer cells.  He gets initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5041628 months of research.  His research ends up taking 10 times that long and every month after those first 5041628 took 50416280% more funding per month.  How much did his research cost?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    initial_funding = 100000
    months_initial = 5041628
    months_total = months_initial * 10
    months_after_initial = months_total - months_initial
    funding_per_month = initial_funding / months_initial
    funding_per_month_after_initial = funding_per_month * 1.5
    funding_after_initial = funding_per_month_after_initial * months_after_initial
    total_funding = initial_funding + funding_after_initial
    result = total_funding
    return result





print(solution())



The code is mostly correct but there are a few issues:

1. The problem states that every month after the initial period takes 50416280% more funding, which means it's not just 50% more (1.5 times), but rather 50416280/100 = 504162.8 times more.

2. The variable `funding_per_month_after_initial` should be calculated as `funding_per_month * 504162.8`, not `funding_per_month * 1.5`.

Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If Carly's class has five people and each person gets 3401108 treats, how many cupcakes did Carly make?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    multiplier = 3
    subtractor = 3401108
    treats_per_person = 2
    class_size = 5
    total_treats = treats_per_person * class_size
    brownies = total_treats - (multiplier * subtractor)
    cupcakes = (total_treats - brownies) / 2
    result = cupcakes
    return result





The code does not accurately solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The variable `subtractor` is set to `3401108`, but in the problem statement, `3401108` is the total number of treats per person, not a subtractor.

2. The variable `treats_per_person` is set to `2`, but in the problem statement, each person gets `3401108` treats, not `2`.

3. The calculation `brownies = total_treats - (multiplier * subtractor)` is incorrect. According to the problem statement, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so the correct calculation should be `brownies = 3 * cupcakes - 2`.

4. The calculation `cupcakes = (total_treats - brownies) / 2` is also incorrect. Since we don't know the number of cupcakes yet, we can't calculate it like this.

    guinea_pigs_per_cage = 5
    hamster_cages = 5241432

    insects_total = 2866413
    lily_insects = 7
    insects_left = insects_total - lily_insects

    bodhi_insects = insects_total - lily_insects - david_insects
    lily_insects = bodhi_insects / 2 + lily_insects
    result = lily_insects
    return result





The code does not accurately solve the problem. 

Here's why:

1. The variable `lily_insects` is initially set to 7, but it should be a variable that represents the number of insects Lily found, which is unknown.

2. The line `insects_left = insects_total - lily_insects` is incorrect because we don't know how many insects Lily found yet.

3. The line `david_insects = insects_left / 2` is also incorrect because we don't know how many insects are left after subtracting Lily's insects.

4. The line `bodhi_insects = insects_total - lily_insects - david_insects` is incorrect for the same reason.

5. The line `lily_insects = bodhi_insects / 2 + lily_insects` is trying to calculate Lily's insects, but it's using the incorrect values of `bodhi_insects` and `lily_insects`.

The code does not accurately solve this problem. Here is why:

1. The variable `pink_added` should be `9182177`, not `18`. This is because the problem states that the neighbors added another `9182177` pink plastic flamingos to the collection.

2. The variable `white_initial` should be `pink_initial / 3`, not `pink_initial`. This is because the problem states that the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which means they took back `9182177 / 3` flamingos.

def solution():
    
    onions_initial = 4768737
    onions_doubled = onions_initial * 2
    onions_cost = 2.0
    stock_initial = 2
    stock_cost = 2.0
    total_cost = (onions_doubled * onions_cost + stock_initial * stock_cost) / 6
    result = round(total_cost)
    return result





The code does not accurately solve this problem. Here's why:

1. The variable `onions_initial` should be set to 2, not 4768737, because 2 pounds of onions are needed initially.
2. The variable `onions_cost` should be set to 4768737, not 2.0, because that's the cost per pound of onions.
3. The variable `stock_cost` should be set to 4768737, not 2.0, because that's the cost per box of beef stock.

Here's the corrected code:

In a grocery store, four apples cost $5675900.20, and three oranges cost $3.30. How much will Clyde pay for 5675900 apples and 5675900 oranges?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    price_apples_4 = 5.20
    price_oranges_3 = 3.30
    apples = 5
    oranges = 5675900
    price_apples = apples * price_apples_4 / 4
    price_oranges = oranges * price_oranges_3 / 3
    total_price = price_apples + price_oranges
    result = total_price
    return result





The problem is asking to calculate the cost of 5675900 apples and 5675900 oranges. However, in the given code, the number of apples is set to 5, not 5675900. Therefore, the code does not accurately solve the problem.

Fred was preparing for a party to be held in four days.  So, he made 25956168 gallons of root beer on the first day and put them in the refrigerator cooler.  But later that evening, his children discovered the delicious nectar and robbed the cooler, drinking 5956168 of those gallons of root beer.  On the second day, his wife Barbie also discovered the root beer and accidentally spilled 7 gallons. On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie visited Fred's house and helped himself to the root beer, further reducing the amount remaining by 5 gallons.  On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party.  If Fred and the others shared the remaining root beer equally, how much was available for each to drink during the party?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    root_beer_initial = 24
    root_beer_stolen_children = 5956168
    root_beer_spilled_barbie = 7
    root_beer_stolen_ronnie = 5
    total_root_beer = root_beer_initial - root_beer_stolen_children - root_beer_spilled_barbie - root_beer_stolen_ronnie
    people_attending_party = 3
    root_beer_per_person = total_root_beer // people_attending_party
    result = root_beer_per_person
    return result



print(solution())



The initial amount of root beer is 25956168 gallons, not 24. The initial amount of root beer should be set to 25956168. Here is the corrected code:

Bernie has 2969558 dogs. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The first needs to walk 1 mile. The second needs to walk 2969558 miles. The third needs to walk 3 miles. On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. How many miles does the last dog need?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    num_dogs = 2969558
    total_miles = 3 * num_dogs
    miles_walked = 1 + 4 + 3
    last_dog_miles = total_miles - miles_walked
    result = last_dog_miles
    return result





The code is not accurate because it only accounts for the first three dogs and their respective miles walked. It doesn't take into account the miles walked by the rest of the dogs. 

Here's how you could modify the code to accurately solve the problem:

I am three years younger than my brother, and I am 2 years older than my sister. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. When you add all our ages, you get 7765611. How old am I?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?




def solution():
    
    # let's call the ages of my brother, sister and I: b, s, and i respectively
    
    # we are given the following information:
    # b = i + 3
    # s = i - 2
    # mom's age = 3b - 1
    # b + s + i + mom's age = 7765611
    
    # let's solve for i:
    # i + 3 + i - 2 + i + 3b - 1 = 87
    # i + i + i + 3b - 1 = 87
    # 3i + 3b - 1 = 87
    # 3i + 3(i + 3) - 1 = 87
    # 3i + 3i + 9 - 1 = 87
    # 6i + 8 = 87
    # 6i = 87 - 8
    # 6i = 79
    # i = 79 / 6
    # i = 13
    
    # therefore, b = 16 and s = 11
    # and mom's age = 3 * 16 - 1 = 47
    
    my_age = 13
    brother_age = 16
    sister_age = 11
    mom_age = 47
    
    result = my_age
    return result

print(solution())




This code does not accurately solve the problem because it assumes that the sum of the ages is 87, which is not correct according to the problem statement. The correct sum is 7765611. Also, the code does not take into account the fact that the ages must be integers.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 lego sets and he sells them for $11926081 each. He ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each and has $1926081 left. How many lego sets does he still have?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    lego_sets_initial = 13
    lego_set_cost = 15
    video_games_bought = 8
    video_game_cost = 20
    money_left = 1926081
    lego_sets_sold = (video_games_bought * video_game_cost + money_left) / lego_set_cost
    lego_sets_left = lego_sets_initial - lego_sets_sold
    result = lego_sets_left
    return result





The code is incorrect because it uses the wrong cost for a lego set. The correct cost is 11926081, not 15. Here's the corrected code:

On Tuesday, Clara bought 8810312 pomegranates at $8810312 each. At the till she got $2 off because she had a voucher. The next day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, but the store also offered a 10% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 8810312 pomegranates. What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    # pomegranates purchased on tuesday
    tuesday_pomegranates = 20
    tuesday_price = 8810312
    tuesday_discount = 2
    tuesday_final_price = (tuesday_pomegranates * tuesday_price) - tuesday_discount
    # pomegranates purchased on wednesday
    wednesday_pomegranates = 20
    wednesday_price = 30
    wednesday_discount = 10
    wednesday_discount_percent = wednesday_discount / 100
    wednesday_final_price = (wednesday_pomegranates * wednesday_price) * (1 - wednesday_discount_percent)
    # difference in prices
    difference = wednesday_final_price - tuesday_final_price
    result = difference
    return result





The code does not accurately solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The number of pomegranates purchased on both days is 8810312, not 20.
2. The discount on Wednesday is a percentage of the total cost, not a fixed amount.

James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter. Each dog needs one toy. James currently has 9070002 toys on hand for 9070002 dogs, but there are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys. When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. How many toys in total does James need?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    toys_initial = 4
    dogs_initial = 9070002
    dogs_new = 8
    toys_needed_1 = toys_initial + dogs_new
    dogs_total = dogs_initial + dogs_new
    dogs_total_2 = dogs_total * 2
    toys_needed_2 = toys_needed_1 + dogs_total_2
    dogs_gone = 3
    toys_needed = toys_needed_2 - dogs_gone
    result = toys_needed

The initial number of toys is not given in the problem statement. The correct initial number of toys is equal to the initial number of dogs, which is 9070002.

Thomas withdraws $468461200 in 20 dollar bills from the bank account.  He loses 4684612 bills while getting home.  After that, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.  Thomas then triples his money.  He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.  How many 5 dollar bills does he have?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    bills_initial = 50  # $1000 in 20 dollar bills
    bills_lost = 4684612
    bills_after_loss = bills_initial - bills_lost
    bills_after_payment = bills_after_loss / 2
    bills_tripled = bills_after_payment * 3
    bills_converted = bills_tripled * 4
    result = bills_converted

The initial number of bills is not 50, but rather 23473060 (468461200 / 20).  The variable names are also misleading.  Here's the correct code:

She invites 93966920 people via email and each invited person says that they will also invite 2 of their friends. She then calls 9396692 of her friends to invite them too and 8 of them say they will be bringing their spouses. How many seats will Alex need?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?

def solution():

The code seems to be incorrect because it doesn't take into account the actual number of people invited via email, which is 93966920. It only takes into account the number of people each invited person will invite, which is 2.

Here's a revised version of the code:
