    "# PDL - Granite IO Processor Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "The Prompt Declaration Language (PDL) is a YAML-based declarative approach to prompt programming, where prompts are at the forefront. PDL facilitates model chaining and tool use, abstracting away the plumbing necessary for such compositions, enables type checking of the input and output of models, and is based on LiteLLM to support a variety of model providers. PDL has been used with RAG, CoT, ReAct, and an agent for solving SWE-bench. PDL is [open-source](https://github.com/IBM/prompt-declaration-language) and works well with watsonx.ai and Granite models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use PDL stand-alone or from a Python SDK or, as shown here, in a notebook via a notebook extension. In the cell output, model-generated text is rendered in green font, and tool-generated text is rendered in purple font.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how PDL is integrated with the [Granite IO Processor](https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite-io) framework, which enables a developer to transform how a user calls an IBM Granite model and how the output from the model is returned to the user. PDL uses granite-io as an alternative backend to LiteLLM. The following examples show how to call an Ollama Granite model via PDL and granite-io, how to extract hallucination scores and citations, and how to toggle the thinking control, which turns on reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "First make sure you have Ollama installed and ollama serve is running, and that you have pulled the `granite3.2:2b` model."

      "\u001b[32m\n",
      "\n",
      "To find the fastest way—in terms of minimizing cities visited and ensuring every city is covered without repetition—for a seller (let's assume they operate as a last-mile courier within a defined region) to visit all cities along a circular path from any one starting point, your best bet would be to employ specialized algorithms designed to solve variants of the Traveling Salesman Problem. One such tool is Concorde TSP Solver, an open-source exact solver that's renowned for its performance on real-world data sets and industrial scale instances due to sophisticated optimizations, primarily:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Branch-and-Cut Method**: This technique cuts away non-integral solutions iteratively while retaining feasible paths to maintain a balance between improving the objective (i.e., cities visited) and adhering to constraints, thus finding near-optimal results efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Preprocessing**: Concorde uses advanced preprocessing steps like the Lin–Kernighan algorithm followed by linear programming refinement to further improve its running time and solution quality as large instances scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Integration and Use** (Pseudo-Python Implementation Using Python Concorde Library):\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   import concorde\n",
      "\n",
      "   # List of cities, use 0 for home base\n",
      "   cities = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1]  # Example: Cities in order from 0 to nine (e.g., [1-based index)]\n",
      "\n",
      "   # Set starting city (index)\n",
      "   start = 0\n",
      "   \n",
      "   # Run Concorde as an exact TSP solver with a specified timeout (optional; you can set it for more time if needed)\n",
      "   solver = concorde.TspSolver()\n",
      "   results = solver.solve(cities_from=list(range(len(cities))), start=start, max_seconds=3600)  # Adjust 'max_seconds' based on your tolerance\n",
      "\n",
      "   print(\"Optimal Route with Minimum Cities Visited:\", results.best_path())\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      ">> Thoughts:will be a sequence of indices representing the optimal cities to visit that minimizes total visits while covering all predefined locations exactly once, which in the city context signifies the most efficient path for the seller’s courier rounds without revisiting any city till every stop is made. Note that Concorde's results are typically very close to optimal with real-world applications—the primary benefit being scalability and execution speed across diverse dataset sizes. While not an exact polynomial-time algorithm, it outperforms most other methods for large TSP instances due to its sophisticated heuristics and optimization techniques.\u001b[0m\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Understand the Problem**: The goal is to find the quickest route that allows a seller, who operates in a specific geographical region (let's assume this for this exercise as a circular map of cities), to visit each city exactly once and return to their starting point without revisiting any city until all visits are complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Type of Problem**: This problem isn't about distance traveled between two points but rather the number of cities crossed while minimizing repetitions until no more routes are possible. It's similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, with an added constraint: we know some starting and ending (home) point, which simplifies the task somewhat.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Strategy**: To find the fastest route in this context, I'll focus on minimizing total cities visited while ensuring every city is covered—akin to a 1-sequence that visits each city exactly once. This type of solution aligns with what you might consider when planning the quickest delivery schedule for multiple stops from one starting point.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Algorithm Choice**: For such an optimization problem, efficient heuristics and approximation algorithms are often used because exact solutions become impractical for large sets of cities due to their computational complexity. One such popular, widely-used algorithm is Concorde TSP Solver, which employs a branch-and-cut method and can solve very large TSP problems quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Tool Utilization**: Since Concorde is an offline exact solver, I would suggest using it to find the optimal or near-optimal solution. It's freely available for non-commercial use with open source licensing for programming implementations in various languages including C++, Java, and Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Implementation Notes (pseudo-code)**:\n",
      "   - Initialize the software with a list of cities.\n",
      "   - Set the starting city as prescribed, i.e., their home base.\n",
      "   - Run the algorithm (Concorde):\n",
      "     ```python\n",
      "     # In pseudo-Python:\n",
      "      solver = ConcordeTsp(cities, method=\"exact\", timeout=3600)  # Adjust time limit per your need\n",
      "     results = solver.solve()\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - The output `results` will contain the optimal path that visits each city exactly once with the shortest possible total distance (or cost if weights are used), minus some tolerance for computational reasons, which should be negligible in this context since it's an exact solver.\n",
