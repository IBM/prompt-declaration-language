    "# PDL - Granite IO Processor Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "The Prompt Declaration Language (PDL) is a YAML-based declarative approach to prompt programming, where prompts are at the forefront. PDL facilitates model chaining and tool use, abstracting away the plumbing necessary for such compositions, enables type checking of the input and output of models, and is based on LiteLLM to support a variety of model providers. PDL has been used with RAG, CoT, ReAct, and an agent for solving SWE-bench. PDL is [open-source](https://github.com/IBM/prompt-declaration-language) and works well with watsonx.ai and Granite models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use PDL stand-alone or from a Python SDK or, as shown here, in a notebook via a notebook extension. In the cell output, model-generated text is rendered in green font, and tool-generated text is rendered in purple font.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how PDL is integrated with the [Granite IO Processor](https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite-io) framework, which enables a developer to transform how a user calls an IBM Granite model and how the output from the model is returned to the user. PDL uses granite-io as an alternative backend to LiteLLM. The following examples show how to call an Ollama Granite model via PDL and granite-io, how to extract hallucination scores and citations, and how to toggle the thinking control, which turns on reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "First make sure you have Ollama installed and ollama serve is running, and that you have pulled the `granite3.2:2b` model."
