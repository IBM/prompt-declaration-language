    "# Prompt Declaration Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering is difficult: minor variations in prompts have large impacts on the output of LLMs and prompts are model-dependent. In recent years <i> prompt programming languages </i> have emerged to bring discipline to prompt engineering. Many of them are embedded in an imperative language such as Python or TypeScript, making it difficult for users to directly interact with prompts and multi-turn LLM interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Prompt Declaration Language (PDL) is a YAML-based declarative approach to prompt programming, where prompts are at the forefront. PDL facilitates model chaining and tool use, abstracting away the plumbing necessary for such compositions, enables type checking of the input and output of models, and is based on LiteLLM to support a variety of model providers. PDL has been used with RAG, CoT, ReAct, and an agent for solving SWE-bench. PDL is [open-source](https://github.com/IBM/prompt-declaration-language) and works well with watsonx.ai and Granite models.\n",
    "\n",
    "All examples in this notebook use the new ibm/granite-8b-instruct-preview-4k model. You can use PDL stand-alone or from a Python SDK or, as shown here, in a notebook via a notebook extension. In the cell output, model-generated text is rendered in green font, and tool-generated text is rendered in purple font."

In 1609, he landed in North America on behalf of the Dutch East India Company and explored the region around the modern New York metropolitan area. Looking for a Northwest Passage to Asia on his ship Halve Maen (\"Half Moon\"), he sailed up the Hudson River, which was later named after him, and thereby laid the foundation for Dutch colonization of the region. His contributions to the exploration of the New World were significant and lasting. His voyages helped to establish European contact with the native peoples of North America and contributed to the development of trade and commerce. \n",
      "On his final expedition, while still searching for the Northwest Passage, Hudson became the first European to see Hudson Strait and the immense Hudson Bay. In 1611, after wintering on the shore of James Bay, Hudson wanted to press on to the west, but most of his crew mutinied. The mutineers cast Hudson, his son, and six others adrift; the Hudsons and their companions were never seen again.\u001b[0m\n",
