    "# Prompt Declaration Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering is difficult: minor variations in prompts have large impacts on the output of LLMs and prompts are model-dependent. In recent years <i> prompt programming languages </i> have emerged to bring discipline to prompt engineering. Many of them are embedded in an imperative language such as Python or TypeScript, making it difficult for users to directly interact with prompts and multi-turn LLM interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Prompt Declaration Language (PDL) is a YAML-based declarative approach to prompt programming, where prompts are at the forefront. PDL facilitates model chaining and tool use, abstracting away the plumbing necessary for such compositions, enables type checking of the input and output of models, and is based on LiteLLM to support a variety of model providers. PDL has been used with RAG, CoT, ReAct, and an agent for solving SWE-bench. PDL is [open-source](https://github.com/IBM/prompt-declaration-language) and works well with watsonx.ai and Granite models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use PDL stand-alone or from a Python SDK or, as shown here, in a notebook via a notebook extension. In the cell output, model-generated text is rendered in green font, and tool-generated text is rendered in purple font."
