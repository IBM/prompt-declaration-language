      Question: Write the following prompts in PDL:
      Hello world!
      This is your first prompt descriptor!

      Answer:
      ```
      description: Hello world!
      text:
      - "Hello, world!\n"
      - "This is your first prompt descriptor!\n"      
      ```

      Question: Turn the code into PDL:
