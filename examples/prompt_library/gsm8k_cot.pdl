      - question: |-
          Noah charges $60 for a large painting and $30 for a small painting.
          Last month he sold eight large paintings and four small paintings.
          If he sold twice as much this month, how much is his sales for this month?
        reasoning: |-
          He sold 8 large paintings and 4 small paintings last month.
          He sold twice as many this month.
          8 large paintings x $60 = << 8*60= 480 >> 480
          4 small paintings x $30 = << 4*30= 120 >> 120
          So he sold << 480+120= 600 >> 600 paintings last month.
          Therefore he sold << 600*2= 1200 >> this month.
        answer: $1200
      - question: |-
          Noah charges $30 for a large vases and $10 for a small vases.
          Last month he sold five large vases and three small vases.
          If he sold three times as much this month, how much is his sales for this month?
        reasoning: |-
          He sold 5 large vases and 3 small vases last month.
          He sold three times as many this month.
          5 large vases x $30 = << 5*30= 150 >> 150
          3 small vases x $10 = << 3*10= 30 >> 30
          So he sold << 150+30= 180 >> 180 vases last month.
          Therefore he sold << 180*3= 540 >> this month.
        answer: $540
