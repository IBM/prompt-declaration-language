    - question: |-
        Noah charges $60 for a large painting and $30 for a small painting.
        Last month he sold eight large paintings and four small paintings.
        If he sold twice as much this month, how much is his sales for this month?
      reasoning: |-
        He sold 8 large paintings and 4 small paintings last month.
        He sold twice as many this month.
        8 large paintings x $60 = << 8*60= 480 >> 480
        4 small paintings x $30 = << 4*30= 120 >> 120
        So he sold << 480+120= 600 >> 600 paintings last month.
        Therefore he sold << 600*2= 1200 >> this month.
      answer: $1200
    - question: |-
        Noah charges $30 for a large vases and $10 for a small vases.
        Last month he sold five large vases and three small vases.
        If he sold three times as much this month, how much is his sales for this month?
      reasoning: |-
        He sold 5 large vases and 3 small vases last month.
        He sold three times as many this month.
        5 large vases x $30 = << 5*30= 150 >> 150
        3 small vases x $10 = << 3*10= 30 >> 30
        So he sold << 150+30= 180 >> 180 vases last month.
        Therefore he sold << 180*3= 540 >> this month.
      answer: $540

    - question: Ruel has four books of 10 stamps and six books of 15 stamps. How many stamps does Ruel have?
      reasoning: |-
        Ruel has a total of 4 x 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 stamps from the four books.
        He also has 6 x 15 = <<6*15=90>>90 stamps from the six books.
        Therefore, he has a total of 40 + 90 = <<40+90=130>>130 stamps.
      answer: '130'
    - question: Jim ran 16 miles in 2 hours while Frank ran 20 miles in 2 hours. How many more miles did Frank run than Jim in an hour?
      reasoning: |-
        Jim ran 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 miles for an hour.
        Frank ran 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 miles for an hour.
        Frank ran 10 - 8 = <<10-8=2>>2 more miles than Jim in an hour.
      answer: '2'
    - question: There are some kids in camp. Half of the kids are going to soccer camp, and 1/4 of the kids going to soccer camp are going to soccer camp in the morning. 750 kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon. How many kids there in camp altogether?
      reasoning: |-
        There are 750/3=<<750/3=250>>250 kids going to soccer camp in the morning.
        There are 250*4=<<250*4=1000>>1000 kids going to soccer camp altogether.
        There are 1000*2=<<1000*2=2000>>2000 kids in camp altogether.
      answer: '2000'
    - question: Philip has a farm with animals. He has 20 cows, 50% more ducks. Philip also has as many pigs as one-fifth of ducks and cows in total. How many animals does Philip have on his farm?
      reasoning: |-
        Philip has 50/100 * 20 = <<50/100*20=10>>10 more ducks than cows.
        Which means he has 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 ducks.
        So Philip's cows and ducks sum up to 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 animals.
        If there are 50 cows and ducks, that means Philip has 1/5 * 50 = <<50*1/5=10>>10 pigs.
        In total Philip has 50 + 10 = <<50+10=60>>60 animals on his farm.

    - question: Abigail has a report due tomorrow which needs to be 1000 words in length. Abigail can type 300 words in half an hour. If she has already written 200 words, how many more minutes will it take her to finish the report?
      reasoning: |-
        She needs to type an additional 1000 â€“ 200 = <<1000-200=800>>800 words.
        In one minute she can type 300 words / 30 = <<300/30=10>>10 words.
        It will take her 800 / 10 = <<800/10=80>>80 more minutes to finish typing the report.
      answer: '80'
