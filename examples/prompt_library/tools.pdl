defs:
  # Note: Although PDL functions can be properly typed,
  # the input to a function via the LLM is fundamentally a string.
  # Therefore, parsing the input is the responsibility of the
  # function, not the caller. In the future, one could
  # imagine the use of constrained decoding to force
  # LLM to produce a type-compliant JSON as input.
