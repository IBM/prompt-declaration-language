    - - question: How many right triangles with a height of 2 inches and a width of two inches could fit inside a square with 2-inch sides?
      - thought: A triangle with a height of 2 inches and width of 2 inches has an area of 2 square inches because (1/2) x 2 x 2. I need to calculate (1/2)*2*2
      - action: Calculator[(1/2)*2*2]
      - observation: '2'
      - thought: The square has an area of 4 square inches because 2 x 2. I need to calculate 2*2
      - action: Calculator[2*2]
      - observation: '4'
      - thought: 2 triangles would fit because 4 / 2. I need to calculate 4/2
