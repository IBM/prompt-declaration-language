        - - question: Thomas, Toby, and Rebecca worked a total of 157 hours in one week. Thomas worked x hours. Toby worked 10 hours less than twice what Thomas worked, and Rebecca worked 8 hours less than Toby. How many hours did Rebecca work?
          - thought: Given Thomas worked x hours, translate the problem into algebraic expressions and solve with Wolfram Alpha.
          - action: WolframAlpha[Solve x + (2x - 10) + ((2x - 10) - 8) = 157]
          - thought: Find out the number of hours Thomas worked.
          - action: "LLM[What is x, given #E1]"
          - thought: Calculate the number of hours Rebecca worked.
          - action: "Calculator[(2 * #E2 - 10) - 8]"
