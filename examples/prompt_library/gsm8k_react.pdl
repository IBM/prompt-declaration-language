      - - question: Noah charges $60 for a large painting and $30 for a small painting.  Last month he sold eight large paintings and four small paintings.  If he sold twice as much this month, how much is his sales for this month?
        - thought: He sold 8 large paintings and 4 small paintings last month.  He sold twice as many this month. I need to calculate (8 large paintings x $60 + 4 small paintings x $30)
        - action: '{"name": "calculator", "arguments": {"expr": "8*60+4*30"}}'
        - observation: 600
        - thought: He sold twice as many paintings this month, therefore I need to calculate 600*2.
        - action: '{"name": "calculator", "arguments": {"expr": "600*2"}}'
        - observation: 1200
        - thought: He sold $1200 this month.
        - action: '{"name": "finish", "arguments": {"answer": "$1200"}}'
      - - question: Teresa is 59 and her husband Morio is 71 years old. Their daughter, Michiko was born when Morio was 38. How old was Teresa when she gave birth to Michiko?
        - thought: I need to calculate the difference in age between Teresa and Morio.
        - action: '{"name": "calculator", "arguments": {"expr": "71-59"}}'
        - observation: 12
        - thought: I need to calculate how old Teresa is when their daughter is born.
        - action: '{"name": "calculator", "arguments": {"expr": "38-12"}}'
        - observation: 26
        - thought: Teresa was 26 when she gave birth to Michiko.
        - action: '{"name": "finish", "arguments": {"answer": "26"}}'
  question: "Question: Jake earns thrice what Jacob does. If Jacob earns $6 per hour, how much does Jake earn in 5 days working 8 hours a day?"
