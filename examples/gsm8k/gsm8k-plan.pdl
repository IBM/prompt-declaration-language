description: Grade School Math -- for every problem we generate a plan, then exectute and evaluate it.
defs:
  problems:
    read: ./test.jsonl
    parser: jsonl

  MAX_ITERATIONS: 50

  planning:
    function:
      problem: str
    return:
      text:
      - >
        Please generate a high-level plan for solving the following question. 
        As the first step, just say what method and idea you will use to solve the question. 
        You can reorganize the information in the question. Do not do the actual calculation. 
        Keep your response concise and within 80 words. 
        Question:
      - ${ problem }
      - "\nThe plan is:\n"
      - model: ollama/granite3.2:8b
  
  solve:
    function:
      plan: str
    return:
      text:
      - ${ plan }
      - >
        The plan looks good! Now, use real numbers and do the calculation. Please solve the question 
        step-by-step according to the high-level plan. Give me the final answer. Make your response short.
      - "\nThe answer is:\n"
      - model: ollama/granite3.2:8b

  extract_final_answer:
    function:
      solution: str
    return:
      lastOf:
      - ${ solution }
      - Extract the result from the above solution into a JSON object with field "result" and a float as value. Remove any dollar signs or other symbols.
      - model: ollama/granite3.2:8b
        parser: json
        def: result
        spec: { "result": float }
        fallback:
          data:
            result: 0

  compare_to_ground_truth:
    function:
      result: obj
      truth: str
    return:
      lastOf:
      - data: ${ truth }
        parser:
          regex: "(.|\n)*#### (?P<answer>([0-9])*)\n*"
          spec:
            answer: str
        def: ground_truth
      - if: ${ result.result|float == ground_truth.answer|float}
        then:
          1
        else:
          0
