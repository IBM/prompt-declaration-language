{"solution": {"solution": "Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as V.\n\nAccording to the information given:\n\n1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold V/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.\n2. She sold 2 more to the red house than she did at the green house, which means she sold V/3 + 2 vacuum cleaners at the red house.\n3. After selling to the green and red houses, she had V - (V/3 + V/3 + 2) left.\n4. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold (V - (V/3 + V/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.\n5. After selling at the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left.\n\nLet's set up the equation:\n\nV - (V/3 + V/3 + 2) = 2 * ((V - (V/3 + V/3 + 2))/2) + 5\n\nFirst, simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\nV - (2V/3 + 2) = V/2 + 5\n\nNow, let's solve for V:\n\nV - 2V/3 - 2 = V/2 + 5\n\nMultiply every term by 6 to clear the denominators:\n\n6V - 4V - 12 = 3V + 30\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2V - 12 = 3V + 30\n\nSubtract 2V from both sides:\n\n-12 = V + 30\n\nSubtract 30 from both sides:\n\nV = -42\n\nSince the number of vacuum cleaners cannot be negative, there must be a mistake in the setup of the equation. Let's go back and check the equation after simplifying the terms correctly:\n\nV - (2V/3 + 2) = V/2 + 5\n\nMultiply every term by 6 to clear the denominators:\n\n6V - 4V - 12 = 3V + 30\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2V - 12 = 3V + 30\n\nSubtract 2V from both sides:\n\n-12 = V + 30\n\nThis is incorrect. Let's correct the equation after simplifying the terms correctly:\n\nV - (2V/3 + 2) = 2 * ((V - (V/3 + V/3 + 2))/2) + 5\n\n6V - 4V - 12 = 3V + 30 - V\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2V - 12 = 2V + 30\n\nSubtract 2V from both sides:\n\n-12 = 30\n\nThis is still incorrect.

Let's correct the equation one last time:\n\nV - (2V/3 + 2) = 2 * ((V - (2V/3 + 2))/2) + 5\n\n6V - 4V - 12 = 3V - 4 + 30\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2V - 12 = 3V + 26\n\nSubtract 2V from both sides:\n\n-12 = V + 26\n\nSubtract 26 from both sides:\n\nV = -38\n\nThis is still incorrect. There seems to be a persistent error in the setup of the equation. Let's try a different approach by setting up the equation correctly:\n\nV - (V/3 + V/3 + 2) = 5\n\nMultiply every term by 6 to clear the denominators:\n\n6V - 2V - 12 = 30\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4V - 12 = 30\n\nAdd 12 to both sides:\n\n4V = 42\n\nDivide by 4:\n\nV = 10.5\n\nSince the number of vacuum cleaners must be an integer, it seems there was a mistake in the problem statement or in the interpretation of the problem. The number of vacuum cleaners cannot be a fraction. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement to ensure all the information is correct.\n\nGiven the information, it appears there might be an error in the problem statement or in the interpretation of the sales. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, and she sold a third, 2 more, and half of what was left, the sales should add up to the total number she started with, which should be an integer.\n\nPlease double-check the problem statement or provide additional information to solve for the correct number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.", "answer": {"result": -38}}, "matches": false}

{"solution": {"solution": "\n\nFaraday earns $26 from selling sunflowers and $56 from selling bouquets per day, so his total earnings per day are $26 + $56 = $82.\n\nIf each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and he earns $56 from selling bouquets, then each bouquet is sold for $56 / 12 = $4.67.\n\nSince the cost of each sunflower is $2, the profit from selling each bouquet is $4.67 - ($2 * 12) = $4.67 - $24 = -$19.33.\n\nHowever, since Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets, this means that he must have sold 56 / 4.67 = 12 bouquets.\n\nSince each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, Faraday sold 12 * 12 = 144 sunflowers in a day.\n\nAfter 3 days, Faraday would have sold 144 * 3 = $\\boxed{432}$  sunflowers.\n\nAnswer: #### 432", "answer": {"result": 432}}, "matches": false}
{"solution": {"solution": "Adam has $100 to spend on rocks, and each rock costs $5 to buy. So, he can buy 100/5 = 20 rocks with his money.\n\nAdam sells each rock for $7, but he only sells 60% of his inventory. To find out how many rocks he sells, we calculate 60% of 20: 20 * 0.60 = 12 rocks.\n\nHe sells each rock for $7, so his total revenue from selling rocks is 12 * 7 = $84.\n\nAdam initially had $100, and he spent $5 * 20 = $100 on rocks. Since he sells all the rocks he buys, he makes $84 from selling 12 rocks.\n\nTo find out how much money he loses, we subtract the revenue from the initial investment: $100 - $84 = $16.\n\nAdam loses $16 from his initial investment.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{16}$.", "answer": {"result": 16}}, "matches": true}

{"solution": {"solution": "If the fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, then the cost of each watermelon is $80/50 = $1.60. \n\nThe vendor sold each watermelon at a profit of 25%, so the selling price of each watermelon is $1.60 + ($1.60 * 25%) = $1.60 + ($1.60 * 0.25) = $1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00. \n\nTherefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00. \n#### 2\nThe answer is: 2", "answer": {"result": 2}}, "matches": true}
{"solution": {"solution": "\nFirst, let's determine Dora's current age. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years old.\n\nNext, let's determine James' current age. James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.\n\nNow, let's determine John's current age. John had James when he was 19, and James is currently 18, so John is 19 + 18 = 37 years old.\n\nFinally, let's determine the age of John's youngest son. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.\n\nIn 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.\n\n#### 8\nThe answer is: 8", "answer": {"result": 8}}, "matches": true}
{"solution": {"solution": "In one hour, there are 60 minutes. \nAna spends 3 minutes per orange, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60/3 = 20 oranges.\nJane spends 4 minutes per orange, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60/4 = 15 oranges.\nTherefore, Ana will have peeled 20-15 = 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.\n#### 5\nThe answer is: 5", "answer": {"result": 5}}, "matches": true}
{"solution": {"solution": "The cost of the new radiator is $400.\nHe gets it for 80% off, so he pays 100% - 80% = 20% of the original price.\n20% of $400 is 0.20 * $400 = $80.\nHe pays $80 for the radiator.\nThe mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.\nSo, the labor cost is 3 * $50 = $150.\nIn total, Mark pays $80 for the radiator + $150 for labor = $230.\n#### 230\nThe answer is: 230", "answer": {"result": 230}}, "matches": true}
{"solution": {"solution": "I know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so I can use that information to set up a system of equations. Let x be the number of chickens and y be the number of cows. Then I have x + y = 20, since that's the total number of animals. And I have 2x + 4y = 70, since that's the total number of legs. I can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2, and get x + 2y = 35. Now I have two equations and two variables, so I can use elimination to solve for x. If I subtract the first equation from the second, I get y = 15, since x + y = 20 and x - x = 0. So there are 15 cows on the farm. To find x, I can plug y = 15 into either equation. I'll use the first one. So x + 15 = 20, and x = 5. So there are 5 chickens on the farm.", "answer": {"result": 5}}, "matches": true}
