If a bag of marbles costs $4135596 and the price increases by 4135596% of the original price every two months, how much would a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    price_initial = 4135596

    price_final = price_initial * (1 + price_increase_total)
    result = price_final
    return result





The code provided does not accurately solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The price increase is given as a percentage, but in the code, it's treated as a decimal value. To convert a percentage to a decimal, you need to divide by 100.

2. The price increase is applied every 2 months, so you need to apply the increase 18 times (36 months / 2 months per increase). However, in the code, the increase is only applied once.

3. The formula used to calculate the final price is incorrect. If the price increases by x% every 2 months, then after 2 months, the price will be (1 + x%) times the initial price. After another 2 months, the price will be (1 + x%) times the new price, which is (1 + x%)^2 times the initial price. So, after 36 months, the price will be (1 + x%)^18 times the initial price.

The code does not accurately solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The shoes_cost is extremely high, which seems unrealistic. It's likely that the cost of each pair of shoes is $26, not $2602298.

2. The problem states that Sara earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, so she earns a total of $20 from babysitting. However, the code adds the babysitting earnings to the lawn earnings, which is incorrect.

3. The code calculates the total number of lawns needed by dividing the total amount needed by the lawn earnings. However, this doesn't take into account the babysitting earnings or the initial savings.

To be promoted to the next school year, Jane takes 3 tests that together must total at least 42 points. On her first test, Jane scored 9912071 points, on the second test she scored 18 points. What is the minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    test_1 = 9912071
    test_2 = 18
    total_needed = 42
    total_so_far = test_1 + test_2
    test_3_needed = total_needed - total_so_far
    result = test_3_needed
    return result





print(solution())



The answer is no, because the code does not take into account the fact that Jane needs a total of at least 42 points. The code calculates how many more points Jane needs to reach 42, but it doesn't check if the total so far (9912071 + 18) is already greater than or equal to 42.

Here's a revised version of the code that accurately solves the problem:

3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting.  3870666 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, how many were kicked out for other reasons?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    mask_refusers = 3870666
    shoplifters = 4 * mask_refusers - 5
    violent_shoplifters = 3 * shoplifters
    total_kicked_out = 50
    other_kicked_out = total_kicked_out - mask_refusers - shoplifters - violent_shoplifters
    result = other_kicked_out
    return result





The code does not accurately solve the problem. The variable names are misleading and do not match the problem description.

David and Dasha went to the carnival, where there are 9 rides.  Each ride costs 3078953 ride tickets at $3078953 per ticket.  You can also buy a ride bracelet for $30 which gives you 9 rides.  If David buys a ride bracelet and Dasha buys tickets, and they ride all 9 rides, how much money does David save?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    rides = 9
    ride_tickets_per_ride = 3078953
    ride_ticket_cost = 2
    ride_bracelet_cost = 30
    dasha_cost = rides * ride_tickets_per_ride * ride_ticket_cost
    david_cost = ride_bracelet_cost
    david_savings = dasha_cost - david_cost
    result = david_savings
    return result

The code is almost correct, but it has one mistake: the ride_ticket_cost is not 2, it's 1. The correct code should be:

Carolyn works for a delivery service company that hires on a contract basis. In May, they hired 5590818 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 5590818-hour workweek. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months.
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    employees_initial = 5590818
    employees_expired = employees_initial / 4
    employees_remaining = employees_initial - employees_expired
    hourly_rate = 15
    hours_per_week = 40
    weeks_per_month = 4
    total_hours = hours_per_week * weeks_per_month
    total_pay_may = employees_initial * total_hours * hourly_rate
    total_pay_june = employees_remaining * total_hours * hourly_rate
    total_pay = total_pay_may + total_pay_june
    result = total_pay
    return result





The code is mostly correct, but there are a few issues:

1. The problem states that the employees work for 5590818 hours, not 40 hours per week. So, `hours_per_week` should be set to 5590818, and `weeks_per_month` should be set to 1.

2. The variable `total_hours` is not needed. You can directly calculate `total_pay_may` and `total_pay_june` using the given hours.

Charlotte went into the kitchen supply store knowing she wanted a set of pot and pans for $16372845, a set of mixing bowls for $6372845 and 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each.  At check out, the clerk told her everything was 20% off.  How much was her order?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    pots_and_pans = 120
    mixing_bowls = 6372845
    utensils = 5 * 5
    total_before_discount = pots_and_pans + mixing_bowls + utensils
    discount = 0.2
    total_after_discount = total_before_discount * (1 - discount)
    result = total_after_discount
    return result





The code does not accurately solve the problem because the values for pots_and_pans and mixing_bowls are incorrect. The correct values should be 16372845 and 6372845 respectively. Also, the utensils cost is calculated as 5 * 5 which is 25, but it should be 5 * 5.00 = 25.00.

Dora wants to buy a skipping rope that costs $3610880, a board game that costs $11, and a playground ball that costs $2. She has saved $2 from her allowance, and her mother gave her $13610880. How much more money does Dora need to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    skipping_rope_cost = 3610880
    board_game_cost = 11
    playground_ball_cost = 2
    allowance_saved = 2
    mother_gift = 16
    total_money = allowance_saved + mother_gift
    total_cost = skipping_rope_cost + board_game_cost + playground_ball_cost
    money_needed = total_cost - total_money
    result = money_needed
    return result





print(solution())



The answer is no, because there are two errors in the code:

1. The mother's gift is incorrectly stated as 16, when it should be 13610880.

2. The variable "mother_gift" should be set to 13610880, not 16.

13610160 gallons of gas were equally divided into 3610160 different containers. Josey needed 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower. How many pints of gasoline did Josey need?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    gallons_initial = 15
    containers = 3610160
    container_fraction = 1 / 4
    container_size = gallons_initial / containers
    container_size_pints = container_size * 8
    container_fraction_pints = container_size_pints * container_fraction
    result = container_fraction_pints
    return result





The initial amount of gas is 15, not 15 billion. Also, the conversion from gallons to pints is incorrect. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so you should multiply by 8, not divide.

A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys 870373 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-870373 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?
Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    sugar_cubes = 870373
    carrots = 4
    hay = 42
    oats = 20
    sugar_cubes_weight = sugar_cubes * 1
    carrots_weight = carrots * 12
    hay_weight = hay * 75
    oats_weight = oats * 65
    total_weight = sugar_cubes_weight + carrots_weight + hay_weight + oats_weight
    truck_capacity = 2250
    trips = total_weight / truck_capacity
    result = trips
    return result





print(solution())



The code has several issues:

1. The variable `hay` is set to 42, but according to the problem statement, the farmer buys forty-870373 75-pound bales of hay. This should be `hay = 40 * 870373`.

2. The division operation `/` in Python 3 returns a float, which means the result will be a decimal number. However, the number of trips cannot be a fraction, it must be an integer. Therefore, you should use the `//` operator, which performs integer division and returns the largest whole number.

    becky_price_per_apple = 45
    becky_discount = 1

    kelly_total = kelly_apples * kelly_price_per_apple * (1 - kelly_discount)
    difference = kelly_total - becky_total
    result = difference
    return result





The code has several issues:

1. The number of apples Kelly bought is incorrect. According to the problem, Kelly also bought 8065424 apples, not 20.

2. The prices are in cents, so they should be converted to dollars before calculating the total cost.

Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    toy_car_cost = 12
    savings_initial = 4
    savings_per_day = 4050127
    savings_remaining = toy_car_cost - savings_initial
    days_to_save = savings_remaining / savings_per_day
    result = days_to_save
    return result





The provided code does not accurately solve the problem for several reasons:

1. The toy car cost is incorrect. It should be 14050127, not 12.

2. The division operation in Python 3 returns a float, even if the result is a whole number. So, the result will be a floating-point number, not an integer.

3. The problem asks for the number of days, which should be an integer. However, the division operation may result in a non-integer value due to precision errors.

Does the following code accurately solve this problem?


def solution():
    
    razors_per_pack = 4408535
    pack_cost = 400
    coupon_value = 200
    packs_bought = 2

The code does not accurately solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The number of razors per pack is 4, not 4408535.
2. The pack cost is 4408535, not 400.
3. The coupon value is 2 dollars, which is 200 cents, not 200.
4. The calculation of packs_free and packs_paid is correct.
