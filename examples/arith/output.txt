Answer: Let's think step by step.
He sold 8 large paintings and 4 small paintings last month.
He sold twice as many this month.
8 large paintings x $60 = << 8*60= 480 >> 480
4 small paintings x $30 = << 4*30= 120 >> 120
So he sold << 480+120= 600 >> 600 paintings last month.
Therefore he sold << 600*2= 1200 >> this month.
The answer is $1200.

He sold 5 large vases and 3 small vases last month.
He sold three times as many this month.
5 large vases x $30 = << 5*30= 150 >> 150
3 small vases x $10 = << 3*10= 30 >> 30
So he sold << 150+30= 180 >> 180 vases last month.
Therefore he sold << 180*3= 540 >> this month.
The answer is $540.
