Question: Noah charges $60 for a large painting and $30 for a small painting.
Last month he sold eight large paintings and four small paintings.
If he sold twice as much this month, how much is his sales for this month?

Answer: Let's think step by step.
He sold 8 large paintings and 4 small paintings last month.
He sold twice as many this month.
8 large paintings x $60 =
{"name": "Calc", "arguments": {"expr": "8*60"}}
480
4 small paintings x $30 =
{"name": "Calc", "arguments": {"expr": "4*30"}}
120
So he sold
{"name": "Calc", "arguments": {"expr": "480+120"}}
600 
paintings last month.
Therefore he sold
{"name": "Calc", "arguments": {"expr": "600*2"}}
1200 
this month.
The answer is $1200.
