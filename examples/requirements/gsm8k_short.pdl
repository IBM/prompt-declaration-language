    Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2 GB/minute, 
    but 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, 
    which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. 
    How load does it take to download the file?
