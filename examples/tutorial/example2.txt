Question: Noah charges $10 for a small vase and $30 for a large vases
Last month he sold five large vases and three small vases.
If he sold three times as much this month, how much is his sales for this month?

Answer: Let's think step by step.
He sold 5 large vases and 3 small vases last month.
He sold three times as many this month.
5 large vases x $30 = << 5*30= 150 >> 150
3 small vases x $10 = << 3*10= 30 >> 30
So he sold << 150+30= 180 >> 180 vases last month.
Therefore he sold << 180*3= 540 >> this month.
The answer is $540.
