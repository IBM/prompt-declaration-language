  def: EXPLANATION
  input: |
      Here is some info about the location of the function in the repo.
      repo:
      ${ CODE.repo_info.repo }
      path: ${ CODE.repo_info.path }
      Function_name: ${ CODE.repo_info.function_name }


      Explain the following code:
      ```
      ${ CODE.source_code }```
  parameters:
    temperature: 0

  EVALUATION:
  The similarity (Levenshtein) between this answer and the ground truth is:
- def: EVAL

  # (Use `pip install textdistance` if needed to install the textdistance package)
  code: |
    import textdistance
    expl = """
    ${ EXPLANATION }
    """
    truth = """
    ${ TRUTH }
    """
    # (In PDL, set `result` to the output you wish for your code block.)
    result = textdistance.levenshtein.normalized_similarity(expl, truth)
