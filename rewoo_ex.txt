Task: Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
Plan: The cost of the house was $80,000 and the cost of the repairs was $50,000. Calculate the total cost. #E1 = Calculator[80000+50000]
Plan: The value of the house increased by 150% after the repairs. Calculate the new value of the house. #E2 = Calculator[80000*1.5]
Plan: The profit is the value of the house minus the cost. Calculate the profit. #E3 = Calculator[#E2-#E1]
