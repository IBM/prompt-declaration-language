Did Faith Hill take a break from recording after releasing her second album, It Matters to Me?

The answer is: Yes, Faith Hill took a three-year break from recording after releasing her second album, It Matters to Me.
I am not hallucinating, promise!
The citation is: After discovering that Hill was
pregnant with their first child, the couple married on October 6, 1996. The
couple have three daughters together: Gracie Katherine (born 1997), Maggie Elizabeth (born 1998)
and Audrey Caroline (born 2001). Since their marriage, Hill and McGraw have endeavored
never to be apart for more than three consecutive days. After the release of It Matters to Me,
Hill took a three-year break from recording to give herself a rest from four years of touring
and to begin a family with McGraw. During her break, she joined forces with her husband
for their first duet, "It's Your Love".
