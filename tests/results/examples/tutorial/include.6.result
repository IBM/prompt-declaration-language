What is APR?
APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the annual interest rate charged for borrowing or earned through an investment, and it represents the actual yearly cost of funds over the term of a loan. It includes any fees or additional costs associated with the transaction.
Can you write a poem about APR?
In the world of finance, APR is the key,
A number that tells you what you'll pay, or earn, you see.
It's the annual rate, not just a one-time fee,
In loans and investments, it's a crucial decree.

It includes all fees, no matter how small,
A clear picture of cost, for one and all.
Whether borrowing or saving, it's a helpful tool,
To make informed decisions, and avoid a financial fool.

So remember APR, when you're in the market,
For loans or investments, it's a vital factor.
It's the annual rate, that tells you the cost,
In the world of finance, it's a helpful host.
Now explain APR to me like I'm 5 years old
Sure! So, imagine you have a piggy bank and you want to borrow some money from your parents to buy a toy. Your parents might ask you to pay them back with a little extra money, like an extra dollar for every dollar you borrow. This extra money is like the interest you pay on a loan.

Now, APR is like a special way to calculate how much extra money you'll have to pay back. It takes into account not just the interest rate, but also any extra fees or costs that might be added on. So, if you know the APR, you can figure out exactly how much you'll have to pay back in a whole year, not just for one month or one day.

It's like a special tool that helps you understand how much something will really cost you, so you can make smart decisions about borrowing or saving money.
