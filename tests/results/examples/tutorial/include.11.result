What is APR?
APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the annual interest rate charged for borrowing or earned through an investment, and it represents the actual yearly cost of funds over the term of a loan. It includes any fees or additional costs associated with the transaction.
Can you write a poem about APR?
In the world of finance, APR is the key,
A number that tells you what you'll pay, or earn, you see.
It's the annual rate, not just a one-time fee,
In loans and investments, it's a crucial decree.

It includes all fees, no matter how small,
A clear picture of cost, for one and all.
Whether borrowing or saving, it's a helpful tool,
To make informed decisions, and avoid a financial fool.

So remember APR, when you're in the market,
For loans or investments, it's a vital factor.
It's the annual rate, that tells you the cost,
In the world of finance, it's a helpful host.
Now explain APR to me like I'm 5 years old
Sure! So, imagine you have a piggy bank and you want to borrow some money from your parents to buy a toy. Your parents might ask you to pay them back with a little extra money, like an extra dollar for every dollar you borrow. This extra money is like the interest you pay on a loan.

Now, APR is like a special way to tell you how much extra money you'll have to pay back, all in one year. It includes any extra fees or costs, like a small fee for taking out the loan. So, if your parents say the APR is 5%, it means you'll have to pay back 5% more than you borrowed, all in one year.

It's like a special rule that helps you understand how much you'll have to pay back, so you can make a good decision about whether to borrow the money or not.
