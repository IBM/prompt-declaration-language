What is APR?APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It's a measure of the annual cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage rate. This includes not only the interest you pay on loans but also any additional fees associated with obtaining that loan. 

Here are some key points about APR:

1. **Includes Fees**: Unlike simple interest rates, which typically don't include fees, APR takes these into account. This makes it a more accurate representation of what you'll actually pay over the course of a year for borrowing money.

2. **For All Loans**: It applies to all types of loans, including mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, and personal loans.

3. **Used for Comparison**: Lenders are required by law in many cases to disclose the APR when advertising loan rates. This allows consumers to compare different loan offers more easily on a like-for-like basis.

4. **Not Just Interest**: While it does include interest, APR also accounts for other costs over the life of the loan, such as points (prepaid interest), origination fees, and discount points.

5. **Typically Higher Than Interest Rates**: Because APR includes these additional costs, it's usually higher than the stated interest rate on a loan. For example, if you're looking at an annual percentage yield (APY) for a savings account, this is similar to how APR compares to the nominal interest rate of a loan.

To calculate your own APR, you would typically need to know the total cost of borrowing over one year and divide it by the amount borrowed. This can be done using financial calculators or online tools provided by banks and lenders.yes
