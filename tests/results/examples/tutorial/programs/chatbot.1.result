What is APR?APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It's a measure of the annual cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage rate. This includes not only the interest you pay on loans but also any additional fees associated with obtaining that loan. 

Here are some key points about APR:

1. **Includes Fees**: Unlike simple interest rates, which typically exclude fees, APR incorporates all costs related to borrowing money over a year. These can include origination fees, application fees, discount points, and other charges.

2. **Reflects Cost of Credit**: It gives you an idea of the true cost of credit when comparing different loan offers or types of loans. 

3. **Used for Comparison**: Lenders are required by law to disclose APR when advertising certain types of loans (like adjustable-rate mortgages). This allows consumers to compare "apples-to-apples" when evaluating multiple loan options.

4. **Not Just for Loans**: While it's most commonly associated with loans, APR can also be used for credit cards and other forms of credit. 

5. **Annualized**: The rate is annualized, meaning it represents the cost per year to borrow $100 for a full 365-day period.

For example, if you're considering two mortgage offers:
- Offer A has an interest rate of 4% and origination fees of $2,000.
- Offer B has an interest rate of 4.25%, but no origination fees.

If both loans are for the same amount and have the same term (e.g., 30 years), APR would help you compare them more accurately:
- For Offer A, the APR might be around 4.16% (including $2,000 in origination fees).
- For Offer B, assuming no additional fees, the APR could be closer to 4.25%.

By comparing these APRs, you can see that while both loans have similar interest rates, Offer A actually costs more due to its higher upfront fee.yes
