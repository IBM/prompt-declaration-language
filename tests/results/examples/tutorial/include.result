What is APR?
APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the annual interest rate charged for borrowing or earned through an investment, and it represents the actual yearly cost of funds over the term of a loan. It includes any fees or additional costs associated with the transaction.
Can you write a poem about APR?
In the world of finance, APR is the key,
A number that tells us what we'll pay, or earn, you see.
It's the annual rate, both simple and clear,
Including all fees, for loans and investments, near and far.

It's the cost of borrowing, or the return we gain,
A figure that helps us make informed financial gain.
So, when you're comparing loans, or investments to choose,
Remember APR, and make the right move.
Now explain APR to me like I'm 5 years old
Sure! Imagine you have a piggy bank, and you want to borrow some money from your parents to buy a toy. Your parents will ask you to pay them back with some extra money, which is like interest. APR is the special number that tells you how much extra money you'll have to pay back, all in one year. It's like a special rule that helps you understand how much you'll owe your parents.
