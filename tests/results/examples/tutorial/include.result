What is APR?

Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is a measure of the cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage rate. It takes into account both the interest rate and other fees associated with the loan. APR is typically higher than the interest rate because it includes the cost of insurance, points, and other charges imposed by the lender. By providing a single, standardized measure of the cost of a loan, APR facilitates comparisons between different loans and lenders. It's important to note that APR is not the same as simple interest, which is only the cost of borrowing the principal amount without any additional fees or charges.Can you write a poem about APR?

In the realm of finance, there exists a term,
A percentage that signifies cost.
Annual Percentage Rate, or APR, you may inquire,
A comprehensive measure, complete and sincere.

It's more than just the interest rate, mind you,
For it includes other costs, quite a bunch.
Insurance, points, and other fees they pile,
APR, in its glory, reveals the ill.

A standardized figure, universal and bright,
Facilitating comparisons in the financial market light.
Though not the same as simple interest, which is but
The principal's price, without the extras' thrust.

So, when you borrow, look beyond the rate,
To APR's comprehensive view, be wise and sage.
For in the world of finance, transparency is key,
And understanding APR, is where it starts.Now explain APR to me like I'm 5 years old

Sure, I'd be happy to explain APR in a simple way!

Imagine you want to borrow some money from your friend, and they charge you a certain amount of money to lend you the money. This extra amount is like a gift they're giving you for letting them use their stuff. The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is a way to tell you how much extra you have to pay back to your friend, including the gift and all the other little things that come with borrowing money.

So, if your friend charges 3 apples as a gift, and you have to eat 5 apples (because you borrowed the money for a longer time than usual), then the APR is 5 apples divided by the number of apples you had to eat (which is the total cost of borrowing). In this case, the APR would be 1 apple.

This way, you can easily understand how much more you'll be paying back to your friend compared to just the interest rate. APR helps everyone compare prices and make better decisions when borrowing money.
