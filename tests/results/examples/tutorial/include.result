What is APR?

Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is a measure of the cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. It includes the interest rate and any additional fees or charges associated with the loan over a year. APR helps consumers compare different loan offers by providing a standardized, easy-to-understand rate. By law, lenders are required to disclose the APR when advertising consumer loans. This way, borrowers can make more informed decisions about which loan is best for them.Can you write a poem about APR?

In the realm of lending, there exists a term,
A figure that tells tales of cost and care.
Annual Percentage Rate, or APR, so eloquently phrased,
A single digit guide to the heart of engaged.

Interest rate, it starts, with a whisper in the ear,
Then, compounding interests add some cheer.
Fees and charges, like shadows at twilight, loom,
APR, the silent guardian, ensures no hidden gloom.

A standardized figure, clear and bright,
APR guides the borrower through the financial night.
Required by law, in ads it must shine,
A beacon of transparency, in the lending world.

So, when comparing loans, take heed and compare,
Not just the interest rate, but also the compare.
APR, the faithful friend, will reveal,
The true cost of borrowing, under the financial moon.

Borrow wisely, borrow well, and pay with grace,
Understanding APR, will help you make your move.Now explain APR to me like I'm 5 years old

 APR is like the fee you have to pay when you borrow money, like from a toy store or a bank. It's made up of two main things: one is the interest rate, which is how much you pay just for having the money, and the other things are extra costs, like a wrapping paper fee or a membership card. All these costs added together give you the APR, which helps everyone understand how much the toy or game will actually cost when you play with it for a whole year. Just like how you might want to know how much a toy costs before deciding to buy it, knowing the APR helps you understand the total cost of borrowing money.
