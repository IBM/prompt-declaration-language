What is APR?
APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the annual interest rate charged for borrowing or earned through an investment, and it represents the actual yearly cost of funds over the term of a loan. It includes any fees or additional costs associated with the transaction.
Can you write a poem about APR?
In the world of finance, APR is the key,
A number that tells us what we'll pay, or earn, you see.
It's the annual rate, both simple and clear,
Including all fees, for loans and investments, near and far.

It's the cost of borrowing, or the return we get,
A number that helps us make informed financial bets.
So, when you're comparing loans, or investments to choose,
Look for the APR, and make your decision, with a clear view.
Now explain APR to me like I'm 5 years old
Sure! Imagine you have a piggy bank, and you want to borrow some money from your parents to buy a toy. Your parents will charge you some money to borrow that toy, and that's like the APR. It's the amount of money you have to pay back, including any extra fees, every year. So, if you borrow $10 and the APR is 10%, you'll have to pay back $11 at the end of the year.
