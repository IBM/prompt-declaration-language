Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the total cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. It includes the interest rate and any additional fees or charges associated with the loan. APR is used to compare different loan offers and to understand the true cost of borrowing money over time.

A figure that's both intriguing and profound,
Annual Percentage Rate, or APR, it's called,
A beacon that shines, to help you choose your ground.

But other costs, both big and small, combined,
APR, like a lighthouse, guides you through the fray,
Illuminating the path to a wiser day.

Ask for APR, and compare it all,
For in the end, it's this number you'll see,
That truly reveals the cost of being free.
