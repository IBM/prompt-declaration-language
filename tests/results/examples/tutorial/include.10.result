Can you write a poem about APR?
In the world of finance, APR is the key,
A number that tells us what we'll pay, or earn, you see.
It's the annual rate, both simple and clear,
Including all fees, for those who lend or invest, it's near.

It's the cost of borrowing, or the return we gain,
In the world of loans and investments, it's a vital chain.
So, when you're making decisions, about money and such,
Remember APR, and make sure it's within your budget's touch.
Now explain APR to me like I'm 5 years old
Sure! Imagine you have a piggy bank and you want to borrow some money from your parents to buy a toy. Your parents will ask you to pay them back with some extra money, which is like interest. APR is the special number that tells you how much extra money you have to pay back each year, including any extra fees. It helps you understand how much the toy really costs.
