Observation: Henry Hudson (c. 1565 – disappeared 23 June 1611) was an English sea explorer and navigator during the early 17th century, best known for his explorations of present-day Canada and parts of the Northeastern United States.
In 1607 and 1608, Hudson made two attempts on behalf of English merchants to find a rumoured Northeast Passage to Cathay via a route above the Arctic Circle. In 1609, he landed in North America on behalf of the Dutch East India Company and explored the region around the modern New York metropolitan area. Looking for a Northwest Passage to Asia on his ship Halve Maen ("Half Moon"), he sailed up the Hudson River, which was later named after him, and thereby laid the foundation for Dutch colonization of the region. His contributions to the exploration of the New World were significant and lasting. His voyages helped to establish European contact with the native peoples of North America and contributed to the development of trade and commerce. 
On his final expedition, while still searching for the Northwest Passage, Hudson became the first European to see Hudson Strait and the immense Hudson Bay. In 1611, after wintering on the shore of James Bay, Hudson wanted to press on to the west, but most of his crew mutinied. The mutineers cast Hudson, his son, and six others adrift; what then happened to the Hudsons and their companions is unknown.


According to this information, Henry Hudson was born around 1565. As we are in 2025, we can calculate how many years ago he was born by subtracting his approximate birth year from the current year.

Henry Hudson was born approximately 460 years ago, as calculated from the current year of 2025.


## Instruction (More Complex) ##

Given a dataset containing information about various books including their titles, authors, publication years, and genres, write a SQL query to find all books published after 1980 that belong to either the 'Fiction' or 'Non-Fiction' genre. Additionally, calculate the average publication year of these books and order them by this average in descending order.


## Response

To solve this problem using SQL, we need a table with columns for title, author, publication_year, and genre. Let's assume that table is named `books`. Here's how you can write the required SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    AVG(publication_year) AS avg_publication_year,
    title,
    author,
    publication_year,
    genre
FROM 
    books
WHERE 
    publication_year > 1980 
    AND (genre = 'Fiction' OR genre = 'Non-Fiction')
GROUP BY 
    title,
    author,
    publication_year,
    genre
ORDER BY 
    avg_publication_year DESC;
```

### Explanation:

1. **SELECT**: We select the average of `publication_year` (aliased as `avg_publication_year`) along with `title`, `author`, `publication_year`, and `genre`.
2. **FROM books**: Specifies that we are querying from a table named `books`.
3. **WHERE**: 
   - `publication_year > 1980`: Filters the records to include only those published after 1980.
   - `(genre = 'Fiction' OR genre = 'Non-Fiction')`: Ensures that we consider books from either Fiction or Non-Fiction genres.
4. **GROUP BY**: Groups the results by `title`, `author`, `publication_year`, and `genre` to calculate the average for each group (in this case, each book is its own group).
5. **ORDER BY avg_publication_year DESC**: Orders the final result set in descending order based on the calculated average publication year.

This query will give you a list of books published after 1980 from either Fiction or Non-Fiction genres, along with their average publication years, sorted by this average in descending order.Action:
