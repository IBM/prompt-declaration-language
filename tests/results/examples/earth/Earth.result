What is the circumference of the earth? I believe the best person to answer this question is 1) a geologist, 2) an astronomer, or 3) a meteorologist. Indeed, 1) a geologist, 2) an astronomer, or 3) a meteorologist addressed this question: 1) The circumference of the Earth can be calculated using the formula C = 4πr, where r is the radius of the Earth. The radius of the Earth is approximately 6,371 kilometers. Therefore, the circumference of the Earth is C = 0.000072921159 × 6,371,000 ≈ 40,075 kilometers. 2) The circumference of the Earth is approximately 40,075 kilometers. This value is obtained by multiplying the radius of the Earth (6,371 kilometers) by 2π (approximately 6.283185). 3) The circumference of the Earth is approximately 40,075 kilometers. This value is obtained by multiplying the radius of the Earth (6,371 kilometers) by 2π (approximately 6.283185).
