Here is a simple Python function that computes the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(fib_sequence) < n:
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence[:n]
```

This function starts with a list containing the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1). It then enters a loop that continues until the length of the `fib_sequence` list is equal to `n`. In each iteration, it appends the sum of the last two elements in the sequence. Finally, it returns the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

Now computing fibonacci(15)

def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(fib_sequence) < n:
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence[:n]
The result is: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377]

Explain what the above code does and what the result means

The provided Python function `fibonacci(n)` computes the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number (after the first two) is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- **Initialization**: The function starts by initializing a list `fib_sequence` with the first two Fibonacci numbers: `[0, 1]`.

- **Looping to Generate Sequence**: It then enters a loop that continues until the length of `fib_sequence` is equal to `n`. In each iteration of this loop:
  - The function calculates the next number in the sequence by adding the last two numbers (`fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2]`). This sum becomes the new element appended to the list.

- **Returning Result**: Once the desired length `n` is reached, the function returns the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence using slicing (`fib_sequence[:n]`).

Given that you asked for 15 terms of the Fibonacci sequence, the function generated and returned:

```
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377]
```

This list represents the first 15 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. Each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The sequence starts with `[0, 1]`, then continues with `1` (which is `0 + 1`), followed by `2` (`1 + 1`), `3` (`1 + 2`), and so on, up to the 15th term which is `377`.
