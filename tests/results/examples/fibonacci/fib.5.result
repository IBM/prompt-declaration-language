Here is a simple Python function that computes the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(fib_sequence) < n:
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence[:n]
```

This function starts with a list containing the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1). It then enters a loop that continues until the length of the `fib_sequence` list is equal to `n`. In each iteration, it appends the sum of the last two elements in the sequence. Finally, it returns the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

Please note that this function will return an error if `n` is less than 1 because there are no Fibonacci numbers for n < 1.

Now computing fibonacci(15)

def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(fib_sequence) < n:
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence[:n]
The result is: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377]

Explain what the above code does and what the result means

The provided Python function `fibonacci(n)` generates a list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth term. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number (after the first two) is the sum of the two preceding ones, often starting with 0 and 1.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- **Initialization**: The function starts by initializing `fib_sequence` as a list containing the first two Fibonacci numbers: `[0, 1]`.

- **Looping**: It then enters a loop that continues until the length of `fib_sequence` is equal to `n`. This ensures that we generate exactly `n` terms of the sequence.

- **Appending Terms**: In each iteration of the loop, it appends the sum of the last two numbers in the list (`fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2]`) to the end of the list. This is how new Fibonacci numbers are generated and added to the sequence.

- **Returning the Result**: Once the desired number of terms `n` has been reached, the function returns the first `n` elements of `fib_sequence`.

Given that you asked for `fibonacci(15)`, the function generates the first 15 terms of the Fibonacci sequence. The result `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377]` represents these numbers in order.

- **Interpretation**: Each number in this list is a Fibonacci number. For example:
  - The first term (0) and the second term (1) are the starting points.
  - From the third term onward, each number is the sum of the two preceding ones: 
    - `2 = 1 + 1`
    - `3 = 1 + 2`
    - `5 = 2 + 3`, and so on.

This sequence has many interesting properties in mathematics and appears frequently in nature, such as in the branching of trees, the arrangement of leaves, and even in the spiral patterns of galaxies.
