```python
def fib(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

The above code is a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence.
However, it is not very efficient since it recalculates the same values multiple times.
To improve the performance, we can use dynamic programming to store the previously calculated values and reuse them.

Here's an optimized version of the Fibonacci function using dynamic programming:

```python
def fib_dp(n):
    fib_values = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        fib_values.append(fib_values[i-1] + fib_values[i-2])
    return fib_values[n]
```
Find a random number between 1 and 20
15
Now computing fib(15)

def fib(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
The result is: 610

Explain what the above code does and what the result means


The code calculates the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming. It initializes a list `fib_values` with the first two Fibonacci numbers [0, 1]. Then, it iterates from 2 to n and calculates each Fibonacci number by adding the previous two numbers in the list. Finally, it returns the nth Fibonacci number from the list.

In this case, the result is 610, which means that the 15th Fibonacci number is 610.
