Here is a simple Python function that computes the Fibonacci sequence using recursion:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return "Input should be a positive integer."
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. However, it's important to note that this implementation has exponential time complexity due to repeated calculations of the same subproblems (i.e., it performs a lot of redundant work). For larger inputs, you should use an iterative approach or memoization to improve performance:

```python
def fibonacci_iterative(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return "Input should be a positive integer."
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1

    fib_values = [0, 1] + [0] * (n - 2)
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_values[i] = fib_values[i - 1] + fib_values[i - 2]
    return fib_values[n - 1]
```

This version of the function uses an iterative approach with a list to store previously computed Fibonacci numbers, reducing time complexity to linear.

Now computing fibonacci(15)

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return "Input should be a positive integer."
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
The result is: 377

Explain what the above code does and what the result means

The provided Python function `fibonacci(n)` calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones (starting from 0 and 1). Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 0, return an error message "Input should be a positive integer." This ensures that the function doesn't attempt to calculate Fibonacci numbers for non-positive integers.
   - If `n` is 1, return 0. The first number in the Fibonacci sequence is 0.
   - If `n` is 2, return 1. The second number in the Fibonacci sequence is 1.

2. **Recursive Case**: For any integer `n` greater than 2:
   - Return the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers calculated by recursively calling `fibonacci(n - 1)` and `fibonacci(n - 2)`.

The result, "377", is the 15th number in the Fibonacci sequence. To find this value:

- Start with the base cases:
  - The first two numbers are 0 and 1 (since `fibonacci(1) = 0` and `fibonacci(2) = 1`).
  
- Calculate subsequent values using the recursive formula:
  - `fibonacci(3) = fibonacci(2) + fibonacci(1) = 1 + 0 = 1`
  - `fibonacci(4) = fibonacci(3) + fibonacci(2) = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - Continue this process up to `fibonacci(15)`.

- The Fibonacci sequence grows rapidly, so here are the first few terms for clarity:
  - 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377

Thus, `fibonacci(15)` returns **377**, which is the 15th number in this sequence.
