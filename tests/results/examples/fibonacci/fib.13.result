Here is a simple Python function to compute the Fibonacci sequence:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return "Input should be a positive integer."
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b
```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

15
Now computing fibonacci(15)

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return "Input should be a positive integer."
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b
The result is: 377

Explain what the above code does and what the result means

The provided code is a Python function named `fibonacci(n)` that calculates the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence. If the input is not a positive integer, the function returns an error message.

In this case, the function is called with the argument `15`, which means it will calculate the 15th number in the Fibonacci sequence. The result of this calculation is `377`.

So, the number 377 is the 15th number in the Fibonacci sequence.
