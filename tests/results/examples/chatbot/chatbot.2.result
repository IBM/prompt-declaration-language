What is APR?APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It's a measure of the annual cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage rate. This includes not only the interest you pay on loans but also any additional fees associated with obtaining that loan. 

Here are some key points about APR:

1. **Includes Fees**: Unlike simple interest rates, which typically exclude fees, APR incorporates all costs related to borrowing money over a year. These can include origination fees, application fees, and other charges.

2. **Reflects Compounding**: For credit cards or adjustable-rate loans, APR often reflects how interest is compounded throughout the year. This means it may be higher than the simple interest rate because interest is calculated on both the principal and any accumulated interest.

3. **Used for Comparison**: Lenders are required by law to disclose the APR when advertising loan rates. Consumers use this information to compare different loans, as it provides a more accurate picture of the true cost of borrowing than just looking at the stated interest rate.

4. **Can Vary**: The APR can change over time for adjustable-rate loans or credit cards based on market conditions and other factors.

For example, if you're comparing two mortgage offers, one with a 3% interest rate and another with an APR of 3.25%, the latter would be more expensive because it includes additional fees that aren't factored into the simple interest rate. 

APR is crucial for understanding the total cost of borrowing money, especially when making financial decisions like taking out a loan or applying for credit cards.yes
