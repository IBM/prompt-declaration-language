What is APR?Hello?Apologies for the confusion earlier. APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It's a measure of the annual cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage rate. This includes not only the interest you pay on your loan but also any fees associated with obtaining that loan. APR is used to compare different loan offers because it provides a consistent basis for comparing costs across various lenders and types of loans. It's important to note that while APR gives a general idea of the total cost, it doesn't account for other factors like prepayment penalties or compounding interest schedules.yes
