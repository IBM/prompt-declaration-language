What is APR?APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It's a measure used to compare the yearly cost of borrowing money or earning interest on an investment across different products like credit cards, loans, etc. The APR includes not only the interest rate but also any additional fees or costs associated with the transaction.

For instance, if you're looking at two credit card offers: one has a 15% interest rate and no annual fee, while another has a lower interest rate of 10%, but charges an $85 annual fee. The APR for the first card would be 15%, while the second card's APR might be higher than its stated interest rate due to the additional annual fee.

It's important to note that APR is typically expressed as an annualized figure, which means it can help you compare different products on a level playing field. However, it doesn't account for compounding or other fees that may occur more frequently than annually.yes
