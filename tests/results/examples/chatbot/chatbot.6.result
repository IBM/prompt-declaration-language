What is APR?APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It's a measure used to compare the yearly cost of borrowing money or earning interest on an investment across different products or services in the financial market.

The APR includes not only the interest rate but also any additional fees or costs associated with the transaction, such as mortgage insurance, closing costs, and discount points. This gives you a more comprehensive understanding of the total cost of borrowing.

For example, if you're taking out a loan, your APR will give you an idea of what the yearly cost is going to be, including both the interest rate and any additional fees or charges. The lower the APR, the less it will cost you over the year.

It's important to note that APRs can vary based on factors like credit score, loan term, and other conditions set by the lender. Always make sure to read all terms and conditions before agreeing to a financial product or service.yes
