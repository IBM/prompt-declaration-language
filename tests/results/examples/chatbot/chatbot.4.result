What is APR?APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It's a measure used to compare the yearly cost of borrowing money or earning interest on an investment across different products like credit cards, loans, etc. The APR includes not only the interest rate but also any additional fees or costs associated with the transaction.

For example, if you're looking at two credit card offers: one has a 15% interest rate and no annual fee, while another has a 10% interest rate but charges an $85 annual fee, the APR for the first card would be 15%, while the second card's APR might be higher than 20%. This is because the APR takes into account both the cost of borrowing (the interest rate) and any additional fees.

It's important to note that APRs can vary based on factors like your credit score, so it's always a good idea to shop around for the best rates.yes
