APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It's a measure of the annual cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. This includes not only interest but also any fees associated with the loan. APR is used for many types of loans, including mortgages and credit cards, to help consumers compare different lending options more effectively.



I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to interpret "quit" as a command to end our conversation. If you want to exit, feel free to type "quit" or simply stop sending messages. I'm here to assist you until then.
