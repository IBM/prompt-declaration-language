APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It's a measure used to compare the cost of borrowing or credit across different products and lenders. The APR includes not only the interest rate but also any additional fees or costs associated with the loan, expressed as an annualized rate. This makes it easier to understand the total cost of borrowing over a year.
