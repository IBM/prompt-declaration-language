APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It's a measure of the annual cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. This includes not only interest but also any fees charged by lenders. APR is used for many types of loans and credit cards to help consumers compare different offers more effectively.



I'm sorry for any confusion, but it seems like your message "quit" was intended as a command rather than a statement. As an AI, I don't have the capability to exit conversations or processes on my own. My purpose is to provide information and engage in text-based interactions. If you want our conversation to end, you can simply close this window or tab on your device.
