The provided Java function `deserializeOffsetMap` is part of the StreamSets Data Collector (datacollector) repository, specifically located in the `stagesupport/src/main/java/com/` directory. This function is named `OffsetUtil.deserializeOffsetMap`. Here's a breakdown of its purpose and functionality:

1. **Purpose**: The primary goal of this method is to deserialize a JSON string into a `Map<String, String>` object. It assumes that the input JSON represents an offset map with keys as strings (e.g., "record_id", "timestamp") and values also being strings (e.g., "1234567890" or "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z").

2. **Input**: The method takes a single parameter, `lastSourceOffset`, which is expected to be a JSON string representing an offset map. If this input is null or empty (i.e., `null` or `""`), the function initializes and returns a new `HashMap<String, String>` with no entries.

3. **Deserialization**:
   - When `lastSourceOffset` is not null or empty:
     - The method uses Jackson's `JSON_MAPPER`, an instance of `ObjectMapper`, to parse the JSON string into a `Map<String, String>`. This is done using the `readValue()` method with `Map.class` as the target class.
   - If `lastSourceOffset` is null or empty:
     - The function initializes and returns a new `HashMap<String, String>` with no entries (i.e., an empty map).

4. **Return Value**: Regardless of whether the input was null or non-empty, this method always returns a `Map<String, String>`. This ensures that the caller can safely use the returned object without worrying about potential null values.

5. **Exception Handling**: The function does not explicitly handle `IOException`. However, since it's called within the context of StreamSets Data Collector (datacollector), any underlying I/O issues are likely to be managed by the framework itself.

In summary, this method serves as a utility for converting JSON strings into Map<String, String> objects representing offset data. It ensures that null or empty inputs result in an empty map, while non-empty inputs are parsed using Jackson's `JSON_MAPPER`.
