APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It's a measure of the total cost of credit, expressed as an annual rate. This includes not only interest but also any fees charged by lenders. APR gives you a clearer picture of the true cost of borrowing money over one year. It's commonly used in reference to credit cards and loans.



I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to interpret "quit" as a command to end our conversation. However, if you want to exit this chat, feel free to type "quit" or "exit". Otherwise, we can continue discussing topics on various subjects.
