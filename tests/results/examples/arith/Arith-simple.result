Question: Noah charges $60 for a large painting and $30 for a small painting.
Last month he sold eight large paintings and four small paintings.
If he sold twice as much this month, how much is his sales for this month?

Answer: Let's think step by step.
He sold 8 large paintings and 4 small paintings last month.
He sold twice as many this month.
8 large paintings x $60 = << 8*60= 480 >> 480
4 small paintings x $30 = << 4*30= 120 >> 120
So he sold << 480+120= 600 >> 600 paintings last month.
Therefore he sold << 600*2= 1200 >> this month.
The answer is $1200.

Question: Noah charges $10 for a small vase and $30 for a large vases
Last month he sold five large vases and three small vases.
If he sold three times as much this month, how much is his sales for this month?

Answer: Let's think step by step.
He sold 5 large vases and 3 small vases last month.
He sold three times as many this month.
5 large vases x $30 = << 5*30= 150 >> 150
3 small vases x $10 = << 3*10= 30 >> 30
So he sold << 150+30= 180 >> 180 vases last month.
Therefore he sold << 180*3= 540 >> this month.
The answer is $540.

Question: Noah charges $10 for a large box and $5 for a small box.
Last month he sold four large boxes and two small boxes.
If he sold half as much this month, how much is his sales for this month?

Answer: Let's think step by step.
He sold 4 large boxes and 2 small boxes last month.
He sold half as many this month.
4 large boxes x $10 = << 4*10= 40 >> 40
2 small boxes x $5 = << 2*5= 10 >> 10
So he sold << 40+10= 50 >> 50 boxes last month.
Therefore he sold << 50/2= 25.0 >> this month.
The answer is 25
