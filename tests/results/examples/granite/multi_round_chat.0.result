What is APR?
APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It's a measure of the cost of a loan, expressed as a yearly rate that includes not only interest but also other charges or fees that may be associated with the loan. This allows consumers to compare different loans and understand their true cost more easily. APR is calculated by taking into account the interest rate, points, mortgage insurance, and other costs over the life of the loan. It's important to note that APR doesn't necessarily reflect the actual interest rate you'll be charged; it's a standardized way to compare loans from different lenders.
Can you write a poem about APR?
In finance, there's a term so neat,
APR, it helps us to compete.
Not just interest, but all the fees,
A yearly rate that sets loans free.

From mortgages to credit cards,
It guides our choices, as per the charts.
Points, insurance, and more,
In this calculation, they're no chore.

A standardized tool for comparison,
Helping us avoid financial frustration.
Though it may not reflect the true rate,
APR is a helpful trait.

So when you borrow, take a peek,
At APR, and don't be meek.
Understand its power, use it wisely,
And watch your finances flourish with ease.
Now explain APR to me like I'm 5 years old
Sure! Imagine you want to buy a toy that costs $100. You can either pay the full $100 right away or borrow it and pay back more over time.

APR is like a special number that tells you how much more you'll have to pay in total when you borrow money. It includes not just the extra money you pay for using someone else's cash (that's like interest), but also any other costs, like fees for taking the loan or insurance to protect the lender if you can't pay back.

So, if your APR is 10%, that means you'll have to pay an extra $10 on top of the $100 you're borrowing. That's a total of $110. It's like a little extra for using their money, and it helps everyone understand how much more things cost when we borrow instead of saving up.
