What is APR?

Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is a measure that represents the annual cost of borrowing money, including interest payments and other fees. It is expressed as a percentage and is used to compare different loan offers and determine the true cost of borrowing. APR takes into account the interest rate, points, and other charges associated with the loan, providing a more accurate picture of the total cost of a loan compared to just the interest rate alone. By considering all these factors, APR helps borrowers make informed decisions about which loans offer the best value.Can you write a poem about APR?

APR is like a special word that grown-ups use when they borrow money from a place like a bank. It's a way to know how much it will cost them to get that money over a year. APR includes not only the interest rate, which is like the cost of borrowing the money, but also things like fees and extra costs. By adding it all up, APR gives a better idea of how much the loan will really cost. So, when choosing a loan, it's important to look at the APR to make sure it's a good deal.
