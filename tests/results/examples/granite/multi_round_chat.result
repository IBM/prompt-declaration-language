What is APR?

Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is a measure of the cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage rate. It takes into account not only the interest rate but also any additional charges or fees associated with the loan. APR is typically higher than the interest rate because it reflects the total cost of borrowing over the entire year. For example, if you borrow $100 at an annual interest rate of 5% and a one-time origination fee of 3%, the APR would be 5% + 3% = 8%. This means that you would pay $8 more in interest and fees than the amount you borrowed in one year. APR is widely used when comparing different loan offers because it provides a comprehensive view of the total cost of borrowing.
Can you write a poem about APR?

In the realm of finance, there exists a term,
A player of great import, many facets to comb.
 APR, or Annual Percentage Rate, it's called,
A measure of cost, for loans of all kinds, it's famed.

Not just the simple interest, but other expenses too,
Like processing fees and doc stamps, they apply.
So, when comparing loans, don't just focus on rate,
Look deeper, look wider, at APR, the complete throttle.

For instance, if you borrow a thousand bones,
At five percent interest, annually, it's true,
But if there's a three percent charge to originate,
The APR becomes eight, that much is sure.

That extra three percent, it might not seem so much,
Yet, over time, it adds up quite a bit, lots.
So, let APR be your guide, in this financial odyssey,
It will show you the way, to the best deal indeed.

Remember, APR is not just a number game,
It's a story of costs, in dollars and sense.
Take the time to understand, to compare, to examine,
And you'll navigate the financial world with confidence.Now explain APR to me like I'm 5 years old

APR is like a special word that grown-ups use when they borrow money from someone. It's like a price they have to pay for borrowing the money. The APR tells them how much it will cost them to borrow the money for a whole year. It includes not just the interest they need to pay back, but also some other fees that come with taking the loan. So, APR helps everyone understand the total cost of borrowing money.
