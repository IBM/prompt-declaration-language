What is APR?
APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the annual interest rate charged for borrowing or earned through an investment, and it represents the actual yearly cost of funds over the term of a loan. It includes any fees or additional costs associated with the transaction.
Can you write a poem about APR?
In the world of finance, APR is the key,
A number that tells you what you'll pay, or earn, you see.
It's the annual rate, not just a one-time fee,
In loans and investments, it's a crucial decree.

It includes all fees, no matter how small,
A clear picture of cost, for one and all.
Whether borrowing or investing, APR is the guide,
To make informed decisions, with confidence, you'll abide.
Now explain APR to me like I'm 5 years old
Sure! Imagine you have a piggy bank, and you want to borrow some money from your friend to buy a toy. Your friend says you can borrow the money, but you have to pay them back with a little extra. The extra is like the interest, and the APR is the special number that tells you how much extra you have to pay back each year. It's like a rule that helps you understand how much you'll owe your friend for borrowing their money.
