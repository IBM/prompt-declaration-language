What is APR?
APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the annual interest rate charged for borrowing or earned through an investment, and it represents the actual yearly cost of funds over the term of a loan. It includes any fees or additional costs associated with the transaction.
Can you write a poem about APR?
In the world of finance, APR is the key,
A number that tells you what you'll pay, or earn, you see.
It's the annual rate, not just a one-time fee,
In loans and investments, it's a crucial decree.

It includes all fees, no matter how small,
So you can make informed decisions, standing tall.
Whether borrowing or investing, APR is your guide,
To understand the true cost, or the reward you'll glide.
Now explain APR to me like I'm 5 years old
Sure! Imagine you have a piggy bank, and you want to borrow some money from your friend to buy a toy. Your friend says you can borrow $10, but you have to pay back $11 at the end of the year. The $1 is the interest, and the APR is the way we show how much interest you'll pay for the year. In this case, the APR is 10%, because you're paying 10% of the amount you borrowed as interest.
