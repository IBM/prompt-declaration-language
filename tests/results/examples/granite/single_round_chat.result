yes

Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is a measure that represents the yearly cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. It includes the interest rate and other fees related to the loan, if any. APR is used to compare different loan offers and is a more accurate representation of the total cost of borrowing than simply looking at the interest rate alone. It's essential to consider both the interest rate and APR when evaluating loan options to make an informed decision.
