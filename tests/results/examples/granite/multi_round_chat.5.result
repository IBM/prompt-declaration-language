What is APR?
APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the annual interest rate charged for borrowing or earned through an investment, and it represents the actual yearly cost of funds over the term of a loan. It includes any fees or additional costs associated with the transaction.
Can you write a poem about APR?
In the world of finance, APR is the key,
A number that tells you what you'll pay, or earn, you see.
It's the annual cost of borrowing, or the return on your investment,
Including fees and charges, it's a number that's essential.

So when you're taking out a loan, or investing your cash,
Be sure to look at the APR, and don't be in a rush.
It's a number that can save you money, or cost you more,
So make sure you understand it, before you sign that store.
Now explain APR to me like I'm 5 years old
Sure! So, imagine you borrowed some money from your friend to buy a toy. Your friend wants to know how much you'll pay back, including any extra fees. The APR is like a special number that helps you figure that out. It tells you how much you'll pay back each year, including any extra fees, so you can know exactly how much you'll owe.
