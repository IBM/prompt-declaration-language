What is APR?
APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the annual interest rate charged for borrowing or earned through an investment, and it represents the actual yearly cost of funds over the term of a loan. It includes any fees or additional costs associated with the transaction.
Can you write a poem about APR?
In the world of finance, APR is the key,
A number that tells you what you'll pay, or earn, you see.
It's the annual rate, not just a one-time fee,
In loans and investments, it's a crucial decree.

It includes all fees, no matter how small,
A clear picture of cost, for one and all.
Whether borrowing or saving, it's a helpful tool,
To make informed decisions, and avoid a financial fool.

So remember APR, when you're in the market,
For loans or investments, it's a vital factor.
It's the annual rate, that tells you the cost,
In the world of finance, it's a helpful host.
Now explain APR to me like I'm 5 years old
Sure! So, imagine you have a piggy bank and you want to borrow some money from your parents to buy a toy. Your parents might ask you to pay them back with a little extra money, like an extra dollar for every dollar you borrow. This extra money is like the interest you pay on a loan.

Now, APR is like a special way to measure how much extra money you have to pay back. It tells you how much interest you'll pay each year, based on the amount you borrowed and the interest rate your parents set.

So, if your parents say the APR is 10%, that means you'll have to pay back 10% more than you borrowed each year. For example, if you borrow $10, you'll have to pay back $11 at the end of the year.

APR is important because it helps you understand how much you'll have to pay back when you borrow money, and it can help you make better decisions about loans and investments.
