APR, or Annual Percentage Rate, is a fundamental concept in finance that represents the yearly cost of borrowing money, including any fees or additional charges. It's expressed as a percentage and is used to calculate the total amount of interest paid over the life of a loan. APR is crucial for comparing different loan offers and understanding the true cost of borrowing. By taking into account both the interest rate and other fees, APR provides a more comprehensive view of the loan's overall expense compared to just the interest rate alone.
