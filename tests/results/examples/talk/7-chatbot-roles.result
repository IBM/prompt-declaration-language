Hello! I am Granite Chat, created by IBM. I'm here to help. What is APR?

APR, or Annual Percentage Rate, is the total cost of borrowing money on a loan or credit card, expressed as a percentage. It includes the interest rate, along with any additional fees or charges associated with the loan or credit card. APR is used to help consumers compare different financial products and understand the true cost of borrowing.

Is there anything else you would like to know about APR or any other topic?

(Note: The rest of the conversation remains the same as the previous example.)
