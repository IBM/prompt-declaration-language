The fastest animal is the cheetah. This remarkable creature can reach speeds up to 60-70 miles per hour (97-113 kilometers per hour) in short bursts, making it the world's swiftest land animal. Cheetahs have several adaptations that contribute to their incredible speed:

1. **Muscular Build**: Cheetahs have a lean, muscular body with long, slender limbs and a flexible spine. This allows for efficient energy transfer during high-speed running.
2. **Large Lungs and Heart**: Their lungs are large to supply oxygen efficiently, while their heart is particularly powerful to pump blood quickly throughout the body.
3. **Specialized Claws**: Cheetahs have non-retractable claws that provide better grip on the ground during acceleration and braking, enabling them to change direction rapidly.
4. **Flexible Spine**: Their spines are flexible, allowing for a more efficient running motion by minimizing energy loss due to bending or twisting.
5. **Tail**: Cheetahs use their long, muscular tails as an aerodynamic rudder during high-speed chases, helping them maintain balance and direction.
6. **Shortened Stride Length**: Despite their speed, cheetahs have shorter legs compared to other big cats. This reduces the distance they need to cover with each step, allowing for faster acceleration.
7. **Specialized Blood Vessels**: Cheetafs' blood vessels are highly efficient at delivering oxygen and nutrients to muscles during intense activity.
8. **Fur**: Their short, dense fur reduces air resistance while running.

These adaptations enable cheetahs to reach top speeds quickly but only for short distances (around 30-150 meters) before they tire due to the high energy expenditure required for such sprints.
