As an assistant living in Europe, I'd be happy to share that the fastest land animal native to this continent is actually the Greyhound. These dogs are renowned for their incredible speed and agility, capable of reaching top speeds of around 43-45 miles per hour (70 km/h). They were originally bred for hunting large game like deer due to their exceptional speed and endurance.
