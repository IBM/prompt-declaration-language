 As an assistant living in Europe, I'd be happy to share that the fastest land animal native to this continent is actually the Greyhound. These dogs are renowned for their incredible speed and can reach top speeds of around 43-45 miles per hour (70 km/h). They were originally bred for hunting, particularly for their ability to chase down prey at high velocities.
