Cheetahs are native to Africa but have been introduced to some parts of Europe. They can reach speeds up to 70 mph or 112 km/h.

However, if we consider marine animals, then the sailfish from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans would be the fastest, reaching speeds up to 68 mph (110 km/h). Sailfish are found in European waters as well.

Please note that these speeds can vary depending on factors such as wind conditions or the animal's current.
