The fastest animal is the cheetah. This remarkable creature can reach speeds up to 60-70 miles per hour (97-113 kilometers per hour) in short bursts, making it the world's fastest land animal. Cheetahs have several adaptations that contribute to their incredible speed:

1. **Muscular Build**: Cheetahs have a lean, muscular body with long, slender limbs and a flexible spine. This allows for efficient movement during high-speed chases.
2. **Large Lungs and Heart**: Their lungs are large to supply oxygen efficiently, while their heart is twice the size of an average cat's, enabling rapid blood circulation to support such intense activity.
3. **Specialized Claws**: Cheetahs have non-retractable claws that provide better grip and traction on surfaces during acceleration and braking phases of a chase.
4. **Flexible Spine**: Their spines are flexible, allowing them to maintain balance while running at high speeds.
5. **Tail**: Cheetahs use their long, bushy tails for balance and steering during turns.
6. **Short, Muscular Legs**: Cheetahs have short, powerful legs with large muscles that propel them forward. Their leg bones are also hollow to reduce weight without compromising strength.
7. **Specialized Blood Cells**: They possess a higher concentration of red blood cells and hemoglobin than other cats, which enhances oxygen transport during intense exercise.
8. **Efficient Fat Metabolism**: Cheetahs can burn fat more efficiently for energy compared to other carnivores, allowing them to maintain high speeds over longer periods without tiring as quickly.

Despite their incredible speed, cheetahs cannot sustain these top speeds for long distances due to the immense energy expenditure required. They typically chase prey for about 30 seconds before needing to rest and recover.
