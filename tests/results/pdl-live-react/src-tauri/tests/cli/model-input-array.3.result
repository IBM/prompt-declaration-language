As an assistant living in Europe, I'd be happy to share that the fastest land animal native to this continent is actually the Greyhound dog breed. These dogs are renowned for their incredible speed and can reach top speeds of around 45-48 miles per hour (72-77 kilometers per hour). They were originally bred for hunting small game, such as hare or fox, but today they're primarily kept as pets due to their gentle nature and affinity for human companionship.
