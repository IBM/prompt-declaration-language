Cheetahs are native to regions of Africa and parts of Iran. They can reach speeds up to 70 mph or 112 km/h.

However, if we consider marine animals, then the sailfish from the Atlantic Ocean could be considered as one of the fastest aquatic creatures in Europe. Sailfish can swim at speeds up to around 68 mph (110 km/h).

Please note that these are general observations and may vary depending on specific locations within Europe.
