The fastest animal is the cheetah. This remarkable creature can reach speeds up to 60-70 miles per hour (97-113 kilometers per hour) in short bursts, making it the world's fastest land animal. Cheetahs have several adaptations that contribute to their incredible speed:

1. **Muscular Build**: Cheetahs have a lean, muscular body with long, slender limbs and a flexible spine. This allows for efficient movement during high-speed chases.
2. **Large Lungs and Heart**: Their lungs are large relative to their size, enabling them to take in more oxygen per breath. A cheetah's heart can beat up to 500 times per minute during intense running, pumping blood rich in oxygen to support its muscles.
3. **Specialized Claws**: Cheetahs have non-retractable claws that provide better grip and traction on the ground while sprinting.
4. **Flexible Spine**: Their spines are flexible, allowing them to maintain a running stride without breaking their backs â€“ unlike other big cats with rigid spines.
5. **Tail**: Cheetahs use their long, bushy tails for balance and steering during high-speed pursuits.
6. **Short, Muscular Legs**: Their legs are short but incredibly powerful due to the muscles attached to them. This helps in generating force for acceleration and maintaining top speed.
7. **Efficient Fat Burning**: Cheetahs have a high proportion of fast-twitch muscle fibers, which burn fat quickly for energy during sprints.
8. **Smooth Skin**: Their skin is smooth to minimize air resistance while running at high speeds.

Despite their incredible speed, cheetahs cannot maintain these top speeds for long distances due to the intense energy expenditure required. They typically chase prey over short to medium distances before tiring and needing to rest.
