As someone living in Europe, the fastest land animal would be the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus). Cheetahs are native to Africa but can also be found in some parts of Asia and Europe. They are known for their incredible speed, reaching up to 70 mph or 112 km/h in short bursts while hunting.

However, if you're referring to the fastest animal in terms of flight, then it would be the European Bee-eater (Merops apiaster). This bird can reach speeds of up to 20-24 mph or 32-39 km/h during flight.
