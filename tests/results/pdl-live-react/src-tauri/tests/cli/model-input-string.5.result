The peregrine falcon holds the title for the fastest animal in the world when it comes to diving speeds. It can reach up to 240 miles per hour (386 kilometers per hour) during its hunting dive, which is known as stooping. This incredible speed makes it capable of catching birds mid-air.

However, if we consider the top speed over a short distance on land or in water, cheetahs are often cited as the fastest animals. They can reach speeds up to 70 miles per hour (112 kilometers per hour) over short distances.
