The peregrine falcon holds the title for the fastest animal in the world when it comes to diving speeds. It can reach up to 240 miles per hour (386 kilometers per hour) during its hunting dive, also known as stooping. This makes it the fastest moving creature on Earth.

However, if we consider the top speed of animals over short distances or across different terrains, cheetahs are often cited as the fastest land animal, with a maximum speed of about 70 miles per hour (112 kilometers per hour).
