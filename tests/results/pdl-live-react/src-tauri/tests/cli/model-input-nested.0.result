These dogs are renowned for their incredible speed and agility on the ground. They can reach top speeds of around 45-48 miles per hour (72-77 kilometers per hour), making them one of the fastest animals in Europe.

However, if we consider wild animals, the Cheetah is the fastest land animal globally and can be found in parts of Africa, including regions near the European border with North African countries like Libya and Tunisia. Cheetahs typically reach speeds up to 60-70 miles per hour (97-113 kilometers per hour), but they are not native to Europe.

For a truly European animal, the Greyhound remains the fastest land creature in our region.
