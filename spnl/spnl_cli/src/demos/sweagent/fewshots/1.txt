Example 1 (do not solve this one):
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
I am getting the following error:
NameError: name 'math' is not defined
--- END ISSUE ---

Below are some code segments from a relevant file. One or more of these may contain bugs.
--- BEGIN FILE ---
### foo/bar.py
import argparse
import difflib
import json
${edit_marker}
from flask import Flask
import pathlib
import re
...
--- END FILE ---

Another developer has proposed the following edit: Add `import math`.

--- BEGIN EDIT ---
Here is my thought process:
I will search for the line `from flask import Flask` and replace it by putting `import math` right in front of it.
Here is my response:
```python
### foo/bar.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
--- END EDIT ---
